       " 'gaza  reuters    a decade on  rawda al zaanoun is at last willing to forgive the  gunmen who killed her son during the civil war that split palestine  it has been painful  but she says it is time   he was hit with a bullet in the back  he was a martyr   the  year old said at an event in gaza city to mark the public reconciliation of families of people killed in the war   the decision was not easy because the blood of our son is precious  but we have given amnesty  her son ala  a married father of two and an officer in the palestinian authority security forces  was killed in june  after he rushed out of his house in gaza city  having heard that his uncle was injured in clashes between rival palestinian factions hamas and fatah  since that war a decade ago  fatah  led by the secular heirs of yassir arafat  has run the west bank  headed the internationally recognized palestinian authority and been responsible for all negotiations with israel  its rivals  the islamist group hamas  an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood  drove fatah out of gaza and has run the tiny coastal strip that is home to  million people  nearly half of the population of the palestinian territories  the schism is set to end on monday  when hamas hands over control of gaza to a unity government  although it agreed to  the arrangement three years ago  the decision to implement it now marks a striking reversal for hamas  which is considered a terrorist group by israel  the united states and most of the most powerful arab countries   hamas has made big concessions  and every coming concession will be stunning and surprisingly bigger than the one that passed  so that we can conclude reconciliation and this division must end   the chief of hamas in gaza  yehya al sinwar  said during a meeting this week with social media activists  if hamas has swallowed a bitter pill by ending the feud  perhaps bitterest of all is the role played by exiled former gaza security chief mohammed dahlan  once hamas s fiercest foe who is now a leading player in regional efforts to pull gaza back into the palestinian mainstream  officials on both sides of the palestinian divide and in other arab countries say dahlan  based since  in the united arab emirates  is behind an influx of cash to prop up gaza  and a detente between hamas and arab states including egypt  his office did not respond to a reuters request for comment  dahlan s return to prominence could have consequences for palestinian politics as profound as the reconciliation itself  as hated as he once was in gaza for trying to uproot hamas  he is perhaps even more reviled by the fatah leadership in ramallah for challenging the authority of president mahmoud abbas  ambitious and charismatic  he has long been suspected of harboring designs to succeed the  year old abbas  among the initiatives dahlan has promoted in gaza is the reconciliation program of families like the zaanouns and  others  who each accepted a    blood money payment from an egyptian emirati charity fund in return for publicly renouncing the demand to avenge the deaths of their sons  old wounds will be hard to salve  activists on both sides hold memories of their enemies shooting out kneecaps or torturing each other in partisan prisons  zaanoun said her family took the decision to reconcile  despite their intense grief over the loss of their son   for the sake of preventing bloodshed  for the sake of blockaded gaza and for the sake of palestine   dahlan has raised millions more  financing mass weddings for hundreds of young couples and distributing cash aid for several thousand needy families  he has also used a close relationship with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi in particular to regain his influence  sisi  who took power by toppling a president from hamas s muslim brotherhood allies  controls gaza s only non israeli frontier and the keys to its prosperity   dahlan worked hard  together with his contacts in egyptian intelligence and sometimes with direct intervention from sisi   a gulf source who asked not to be named told reuters  the strategy may be gaining him good will  an opinion poll last week by the west bank based palestinian center for policy and survey showed that those who still support fatah in gaza are shifting their loyalty to dahlan  his popularity among gazans  the survey said  has risen over the past nine months from nine to  percent  the handover of gaza suggests dahlan s allies in egypt and the uae realize that any bid to put the palestinian house in order  for now at least  needs unity   every time anyone speaks to  israeli prime minister  netanyahu  he would say how can you reach a solution when the palestinians are splintered   the gulf source added   the reconciliation is an effort by several like minded countries looking for a comprehensive solution   he added  short of funds and friends  hamas may have few options but to make concessions  for years it had modest but stable economic backing by islamist leaning turkey and the wealthy gulf arab state of qatar  where hamas houses its headquarters  but in recent months its friends  especially qatar  have been on the back foot  egypt  saudi arabia and the uae have imposed an economic and diplomatic boycott on doha over alleged support of terrorists  including  in their reckoning  hamas  three conflicts with the jewish state left many civilian neighborhoods in gaza pulverized  rebuilding has been thwarted by the israeli egyptian blockade  which sisi has the power to ease  hamas figures blame abbas  fatah and dahlan for encouraging egypt and other arab countries to keep the economic pressure on  forcing hamas to agree to the reconciliation   one of our reasons was to spare our people this suffering which this time was made by palestinian hands   hamas official sami abu zuhri told reuters  senior fatah official nasser al qidwa praised hamas s reconciliation moves and chalked up the group s sudden change of tack to  the governance crisis that hamas is living through and the crisis of foreign alliances  as well as the difficult conditions of some of hamas  traditional allies   imposing its writ over policing gaza and its borders will be the main challenge for the non partisan cabinet of technocrats as it seeks to make this month s unity initiative a reality  setting out a hard line  prime minister rami hamdallah said in a statement on tuesday that hamas must eventually cede all  crossings  security and government departments   gaza bristles with hundreds of rockets belonging to hamas s armed wing  and the movement insisted that the arsenal it says is essential to confronting israel will never be given up       hamas deputy political chief musa abu marzooq conceded in an interview this month with pan arab newspaper al hayat that decisions to fight or make peace with israel should be in future agreed jointly with fatah  but the movement  he suggested  would keep its finger on the trigger   the subject of the resistance s weapons     will not be on the table for dialogue',\n",

       " 'washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump s nominee for secretary of state has set a course for a potentially serious confrontation with beijing  saying china should be denied access to islands it has built in the contested south china sea  in comments expected to enrage beijing  rex tillerson told his confirmation hearing on wednesday before the u s  senate foreign relations committee that china s building of islands and putting military assets on those islands was  akin to russia s taking crimea  from ukraine  asked whether he supported a more aggressive posture toward china  he said   we re going to have to send china a clear signal that  first  the island building stops and  second  your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed   the former exxon mobil corp  xom n  chairman and chief executive did not elaborate on what might be done to deny china access to the islands it has built up from south china sea reefs  equipped with military length airstrips and fortified with weapons   trump s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for specifics on how china might be blocked from the artificial islands  china claims most of the energy rich waters through which about   trillion in ship borne trade passes every year  neighbors brunei  malaysia  the philippines  taiwan and vietnam also have claims  when asked repeatedly about tillerson s comments on blocking access to islands  china s foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said he couldn t make any guesses as to what tillerson was referring to and would not answer hypothetical questions  china s right to carry out  normal activities  in its sovereign territory in the south china sea is  indisputable   lu said  speaking at a daily briefing on thursday  he did not elaborate  tillerson also said washington needed to reaffirm its commitment to taiwan  which beijing regards as a renegade province  but stopped short of trump s questioning of washington s long standing policy on the issue  the united states switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   acknowledging that china takes the position that there is  one china  and taiwan is part of it  but the united states is also taiwan s biggest ally and arms supplier   i don t know of any plans to alter the  one china  position   tillerson said  tillerson said he considered china s south china sea activity  extremely worrisome  and that it would be a threat to the  entire global economy  if beijing were able to dictate access to the waterway  he blamed the current situation on what he termed an inadequate u s  response   the failure of a response has allowed them just to keep pushing the envelope on this   tillerson said   the way we ve got to deal with this is we ve got to show back up in the region with our traditional allies in southeast asia   he said  democratic president barack obama s administration conducted periodic air and naval patrols to assert the right of free navigation in the south china sea  these have angered beijing  but seeking to blockade china s man made islands would be a major step further and a step that washington has never raised as an option   under his strategic  pivot  to asia  obama has increased the u s  military presence in the region  and trump has vowed a major naval buildup  tillerson s words also went beyond trump s own tough rhetoric on china  regional military sources said while the u s  navy had extensive capabilities in asia to stage blocking operations with ships  submarines and planes  any such move against china s growing naval fleets would risk dangerous escalations  obama has sought to forge a united front in southeast asia against china s pursuit of its territorial claims  but some allies and partners who are rival claimants have been reluctant to challenge beijing  tillerson called china s south china sea island building and declaration of an air defense zone in the east china sea it contests with japan  illegal actions    they re taking territory or control  or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully china s   he said  the response was muted from the philippines  a traditional u s  ally that last year won an international arbitration case that included a challenge to china s island building within its  nautical mile exclusive economic zone   these are not policies yet and let us wait if they will implement what was said in the hearing   defense secretary delfin lorenzana told reporters on thursday   let s wait until trump is in office   his comments reflect the sharp change in manila s approach to china under new president rodrigo duterte  who wants good diplomatic and business ties with beijing and says challenging it is provocative and pointless  he makes no secret of his lack of trust in the obama administration and has chided it for what he considers inaction in the south china sea  tillerson also said the united states could not continue to accept  empty promises  china had made about putting pressure on north korea over that country s nuclear and missile programs  he said his approach to dealing with north korea   which recently declared it is close to carrying out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile   would be  a long term plan  based on sanctions and their proper implementation  asked if washington should consider imposing  secondary sanctions  on chinese entities found to be violating existing sanctions on north korea  tillerson said   if china is not going to comply with those u n  sanctions  then it s appropriate     for the united states to consider actions to compel them to comply   he accused china of failing to live up to global agreements on trade and intellectual property  echoing past remarks by trump  who has threatened to impose high  retaliatory tariffs on china  but tillerson also stressed the  deeply intertwined  nature of the world s two biggest economies   we should not let disagreements over other issues exclude areas for productive partnership   he said',\n",

transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of america s worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with muslim extremists  as families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting  a picture began to emerge of the  year old killer as a quiet  devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak  early on sunday  he stormed a packed gay nightclub in orlando  florida  with a handgun and ar  semi automatic rifle  fatally shooting  people before police killed him  fifty three others were wounded  many critically  his ex wife  sitora yusufiy  described him as  bipolar   and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper  she said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by mateen during outbursts in which he would  express hatred towards everything   she was  rescued  by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in  and ended in divorce  she said   he would often get into fights with his parents  but as i was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me   she told reporters in boulder  colorado outside a home where she was staying   she said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in fort pierce  florida  and had once sought admission to a police academy  in fort pierce on florida s southeast coast   miles   km  from the shooting  the imam at the mosque that mateen attended for nearly  years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation   he hardly had any friends   syed shafeeq rahman  who heads the islamic center of fort pierce  told reuters   he would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave   rahman said mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals  he usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week  mostly in evenings and as recently as friday  but he didn t display signs of radicalism  according to fellow worshippers interviewed by reuters  mateen was born in new york of afghan descent but spent most of his life in florida  attending martin county high school in stuart  a small city about a  minute drive from the fort pierce condominium where had most recently lived  a classmate described him as a typical teen who played football  a school yearbook image of mateen was seen by reuters    samuel king  who was one year ahead of mateen  said the two often spoke after mateen graduated in   king waited tables at ruby tuesday s restaurant at treasure coast square  a mall where mateen worked at gnc  the nutrition store  he said  king  who is openly gay  said the mateen he knew until  did not appear to be anti homosexual   what is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at ruby tuesday s when i worked there were gay  he clearly was not anti  gay  at least not back then  he did not show any hatred to any of us   while at gnc  mateen lifted weights and  got really buff   king said  describing mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school   something must have changed  since he last saw him  he added  mateen s father  mir seddique  told nbc news the massacre was not related to religion  he said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in miami a couple of months ago   the fbi twice interviewed mateen for having suspected ties to islamist militants  the first investigation took place in  when mateen made inflammatory comments to co workers that indicated sympathy for militants  fbi special agent in charge ron hopper told a news conference in orlando  at the time  mateen worked as a security guard at   a british owned multinational company that is among the world s largest private security firms   he joined  in september   carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with

was  unable to verify the substance of his comments   hopper said  daniel kime  a security guard employed along with mateen by at  in the fort pierce area  said he met mateen briefly three or four times   every time i saw him he never smiled  if you said good morning  he d just walk right by you  like he had a chip on his shoulder   kime told reuters  daniel gilroy  who said he was a co worker of mateen s at   said that mateen s anger was  constant    any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words   he told fox news   in   hopper said  mateen was investigated and interviewed again  this time for suspected connections to moner mohammad abu salha  an american citizen who became a suicide bomber in syria in   hopper said mateen s contact with abu salha was minimal and it was deemed that  he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time   hopper said mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of sunday s attack  he said mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to islamic state  also known as isis  which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of iraq and syria  but the depth of that commitment is unclear  mateen also mentioned the boston marathon bombers during the call  which he made  minutes into the shootings  authorities said  mateen s former wife said she met mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to florida to marry him  according to the washington post   he was not a stable person   she said   he beat me  he would just come home and start beating me up because

leader some fear could withdraw funding to deter russia  during the presidential election campaign trump threatened to abandon u s  allies in europe if they do not spend enough on defence  comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex soviet baltic states on russia s border which fear moscow might try a repeat of its  annexation of ukraine s crimea  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said nato s promise to defend any ally under attack was an unconditional guarantee set out in the western alliance s founding treaty in    all allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned   stoltenberg told a news conference  saying he would try to speak to trump by telephone as soon as possible and would welcome him to a nato summit in brussels next year   the u s  commitment to nato and the collective defence of europe has been rock solid for almost  years and i am absolutely confident that it will still be the case   stoltenberg said  noting that two world wars had shown the importance of stability in europe to the united states  trump s suggestion of making the united states  defence of its western allies conditional was the first time a leading presidential candidate had raised the idea  putting him directly at odds with nato s  other member states    diplomats questioned how long nato s chief would be able to maintain a  business as usual  tone with a new u s  leader who has expressed admiration for russian president vladimir putin  condemned by the west for his actions in ukraine   the idea that trump s presidency is not going to create problems for nato is delusional   said dana allin  a u s  foreign policy expert at the international institute for strategic studies  iiss   the north

scepticism about nato  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he believes the nato alliance  is every bit as important today as it ever was    i think article   of the nato treaty  means something  you attack any member of nato  you have us to deal with  i want the russians to understand that fully   mcconnell said in washington when a reporter asked him if he shared trump s attitude toward the alliance and russia   one of nato s top commanders stressed that the debate about the alliance s role was not a theoretical one  given the powerful russian air defence systems in the baltic region  in crimea and in syria that could limit nato s freedom of movement  allies need to build up a sophisticated air deterrent that can counter russian long range missiles  said general denise mercer  whose brief is to focus on future threats   after the fall of the soviet union a quarter of a century ago  nato s european allies cut defence spending to historic lows  leaving the united states to make up around three quarters of the alliance s military expenditure   a newly assertive russia under putin has begun to change that and europe is again spending more on defence  but britain  poland  greece and estonia are the only european nations to meet a nato goal of spending at least  percent of gross domestic product on defence  germany  europe s biggest economy  spends far less than  percent of its gdp on defence  asked if she would now seek more funding for germany s military  defence minister ursula von derv leyden told reuters   i have to make it clear  to german lawmakers  what our posture is  what we need and that is the right way to proceed   stoltenberg said he expected an overall  percent real increase in european defence spending in   he said if all european allies and canada reached the  percent spending target it would generate an additional   billion for nato   on financial markets  shares in european defence companies rose as investors bet arms spending would rise in response to trump s calls for europe to pay more for its security  a first sign of trump s tough stance could come as early as next year  when the united states is due to deploy troops and heavy combat equipment to eastern europe under a    billion u s  spending plan for europe to deter russia  trump could scale back president barack obama s plan to quadruple funding under the european reassurance initiative  err  from just under   million   a significant investment in europe after decades of cutting its presence in europe   france saw an opportunity to strengthen european defence   donald trump said he wanted to     stop paying for nato  so countries like poland need to ask themselves  what this means    foreign minister jean marc assault said   rather than lowering our heads  we must rise to the challenge   trump has also threatened to withdraw u s  forces from europe if allies fail to pay more for u s  protection  although u s  ambassador to nato

worryingly authoritarian  and irritation at the price turkey is demanding  stunned eu leaders gave their provisional assent  european public opinion is so petrified by images of tens of thousands of bedraggled migrants trekking across muddy fields and highways towards western and northern europe   and populists have made such capital out of those fears   that governments are desperate to halt the

travel for turks and faster eu membership talks in return for its agreement to act as europe s gatekeeper  european council president donald tusk says regaining control of europe s external borders is a condition for gaining public acceptance to take in refugees  in practice  it looks more like a way of keeping them out  if it can be implemented  human rights groups and volunteers who work with refugees are outraged to see europe slamming shut its open door for victims of war and persecution    eu lawyers are working overtime to try to make it legal  the geneva convention on refugees requires signatories to examine individually each claim for protection submitted by an asylum seeker on their soil  the german turkish deal would get around that provision by declaring turkey a  safe  third country to which irregular migrants could be returned under a bilateral greek turkish readmission agreement   the united nations  top human rights official has said that could entail illegal  collective and arbitrary expulsions   apart from the moral issues raised by this dodge  there are several legal problems  turkey restricts its application of the geneva convention to refugees from europe  people fleeing war or persecution in the middle east and asia will not be covered unless ankara amends its laws  turkish officials say they will ensure turkey complies with international law to fulfill its part of the potential eu deal  even so  lawyers say asylum seekers who reach greece have a right to appeal against being sent back to turkey if they fear for their personal safety there  a greek court would have to hear each appeal before a person could be removed  there is no appropriate court on the greek islands  and greek justice is notoriously slow  at the same time  the rush to declare turkey  safe  could hardly have come at a more embarrassing time for the eu  president tayyip erdogan has stepped up a military crackdown on kurdish militants  the government has seized turkey s best selling newspaper  critical journalists face prosecution and jail  and businessmen and public officials close to a dissident muslim cleric have been purged   unlike trump  most eu leaders do not declare they want to prevent more muslims settling in their country  with the exception of hungary s viktor orban and slovakia s robert fico  who have stressed preserving their countries  christian identity  however  anti immigration campaigners like marine le pen in france and geert wilders in the netherlands openly cite islam as a reason for rejecting refugees  and they are increasingly setting the agenda for mainstream politicians  they oppose visa free travel for turks in europe for the same reason  france  which has a tradition of political asylum and took in tens of thousands of vietnamese  boat people  in the   is limiting its intake of syrian refugees now  citing security concerns following last year s islamist attacks in paris  like other west european countries  france has struggled to integrate second and third generation young people of muslim or north african origin  the place of islam in public life is fiercely contested in these secular societies  and resentments from algeria s war of independence still simmer  european politicians may be aghast at the rhetoric of trump  who has said he wants a database to register and track muslims in the united states and would bar any muslim entering the country until congress could act  but if the pact with turkey goes through as conceived  the eu will be retreating into a  fortress europe

concrete evidence yet that trump campaign officials welcomed russian help to win the election  a subject that has cast a cloud over trump s presidency and spurred investigations by the justice department and congress  the messages show that the younger trump was open to the prospect of  very high level and sensitive information  from a russian attorney that a go between described as  part of russia and its government s support for mr  trump  ahead of a meeting on june       if it s what you say i love it   trump jr  responded  he released the messages on twitter after the new york times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him   bit ly  and bit ly       in an interview with fox news  trump jr  said that trump s campaign manager at the time  paul manafort

any damaging information about clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss russian sanctions   in retrospect  i probably would have done things a little differently   he said   for me  this

yes    moscow has denied any interference  and trump says his campaign did not collude with russia  trump jr  said he did not tell his father about the meeting  he said he may have since had contact

catalonia is back to square one   said marco protopapa  an analyst at jp morgan  forecasting that tensions would quickly return between madrid and an  emboldened pro independence camp eager to exploit

dialogue between the two   we ve at least won the right to be heard   puigdemont said  adding that he was open to returning to spain if given guarantees that he could take his position as head of a potential new catalan government  currently he faces the prospect of arrest for his role in organizing the banned referendum  when the catalan parliament declared independence after the referendum  rajoy invoked constitutional powers to impose direct rule from madrid  he promised to restore catalonia s autonomy regardless of the election result  but could re impose it if a new government again pursued secession      the eu s major powers  germany and france  have backed his anti independence stance despite some criticism of his methods at times  meanwhile  puigdemont s attempts to gain

reconciliation in catalonia  adding that the spanish constitution would have to be respected   secessionists say catalonia pays an unfair share of taxes to madrid  but investors fear independence

parliament after her conservatives haemorrhaged support to a surging far right  two years after merkel left german borders open to more than  million migrants  the anti immigration alternative for germany  afd  stunned the establishment by becoming the first far right party to enter parliament in more than half a century  the afd won   percent of the vote   more than expected and one of many shocks on a night of drama that saw merkel s conservatives get their worst result since   and her main social democrat  spd  rivals their worst since   describing the far right s success as a test for germans  merkel insisted she had a mandate to govern   a formidable challenge as she has little choice but to cobble together a three way coalition with a pro business group and the greens   of course we had hoped for a slightly better result   a humbled merkel said after her conservative bloc slumped to   percent of the vote   down from   percent at the last election in    but she added   we are the strongest party  we have the mandate to build the next government   and there cannot be a coalition government built against us   the euro eur  slipped around   percent in early asian trading as it became clear the results would make forming a coalition tricky for merkel   coalition building could take months as merkel s only straightforward path to a majority in parliament would be a three way tie up with the liberal free democrats  fdp  and the greens   an arrangement untested at national level  the social democrats  who have served with merkel s conservatives as junior partners in a  grand coalition  for the past four years  won just   percent of the vote  as nearly half of voters repudiated the two parties that have dominated germany since world war two  spd leader martin schulz said the party would refuse to rejoin a coalition and instead take up its position as the main opposition  the social democrats appear to have been hurt badly by being in government  making it difficult to distinguish themselves from merkel s conservatives  after shock election results last year  from britain s vote to leave the eu to the election of u s  president donald trump  leaders of europe s establishment have looked to merkel to rally the liberal western order  a pastor s daughter who grew up in communist east germany  she has acted as an anchor of stability in europe and beyond  now  she faces an unstable situation at home as she must form a coalition  an arduous process that could take months  sunday s election  fought against the tense backdrop of surging support for far left and far right parties across europe  delivered a fractured german parliament with six party groups  up from four previously  josef joffe  publisher editor of germany weekly die zeit  said the vote marked a  tectonic shift in german politics  and that the three way coalition merkel looks likely to try to forge will be  highly unstable   leading afd candidate alexander gauland vowed his party would  hunt  the new government  whatever its make up  adding   we ll get our country and our people back   in france  far right leader marine le pen congratulated the afd  tweeting   bravo to our afd allies for this historic showing   a large group of protesters gathered outside the afd s post election party and police said they made several arrests  the european jewish congress expressed alarm at the afd s success  adding   we trust that centrist parties in the bundestag will ensure that the afd has no representation in the coming governing coalition   the afd says immigration threatens german culture  but denies that it is racist   we will neither tolerate xenophobia nor racist positions  but we simply don t have them either   afd co leader joerg meuthen said  the result makes kingmakers of both the fdp and the greens  both of which have played the role in the recent past but neither of which now has enough support on its own to give merkel a majority  fdp leader christian lindner  an ambitious  year old who preaches an ultra hard line on europe and has unsettled the german political establishment  said he was open to coalition talks with merkel but that germany needed a change of course  the greens  katrin goering eckardt said   we will see if there can be cooperation   a three way tie up of merkel s conservatives  the fdp and the greens   known as a  jamaica  coalition because the black  yellow and green colours of the three parties match the jamaican flag   is widely seen as inherently unstable   the greens   keen on regulation   and the business friendly fdp are at opposite ends of the political spectrum and a clash of policy visions would be likely on tax  energy  the european union and migrants  despite losing support  merkel

unfairly fired him from the defense intelligence agency  dia  in  for telling hard truths about the war on islamist extremism  named on thursday to become trump s national security adviser  flynn is now poised for a second act in public life   and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval      we just went through a revolution   flynn    told a forum on saturday   this is probably the biggest election in our nation s history  since bringing on george washington when he decided not to be a king  that s how important this is   flynn s advocates say his experience battling radical islamist militants in iraq and afghanistan  along with candor that has ruffled feathers in washington more than once  makes him the kind of ally trump needs on his national security team  david deptula  a retired air force lieutenant general who used to work with flynn  praised his willingness to  speak truth to power and not politicize his answers    mike flynn is a straight shooter and a no bullshit kind of guy  and that s exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership   deptula said  his critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at dia  a lumbering bureaucracy that flynn sought to shake up  that s an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement  flynn could not be reached for comment  several former u s  officials who worked closely with flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the dia that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials   flynn understood that dia was a mess   one said   but he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas  no matter their merits   two other former officials also said they had concerns about flynn s management style  a potential liability in a white house job that requires coordinating u s  policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies  one of the officials said senior career dia officials and other agency employees held flynn responsible for an offensive  dress for success  presentation that was distributed to the workforce in january   it recommended gender specific fashion guidelines  urged people to  consider your body type  and said makeup made women  more attractive       flynn apologized for the presentation in a subsequent memo that said neither he nor the agency  condone this briefing   flynn s policy views suggest he will take a more aggressive approach against islamist militants  former colleagues expect his effort to bolster america s battle against jihadists to be shaped by his belief that the united states is losing a global war against islamist extremism that may last for generations  in a new book flynn co authored  he prescribes a harder political line on iran  including information warfare to expose shortcomings in iran s revolution  like trump  flynn calls the  invasion of iraq a strategic blunder and says that energy should have been directed instead toward political support for opponents of iran s theocratic rulers  he shares trump s vision of warmer relations with israel  but also advocates stronger ties with egypt  whose autocratic president  abdel fattah al sisi  ousted the muslim brotherhood and was the first world leader to congratulate trump on his victory  flynn s appearances on russia s government run broadcaster rt  particularly at a gala last year attended by president vladimir putin  have also raised eyebrows in military circles   however  he has also expressed skepticism about moscow s intentions   a view that does not seem to fit trump s vision of a new era of detente with the kremlin   although he has more experience battling the taliban  al qaeda and other militant groups than anyone else in trump s inner circle  flynn s critics in the intelligence community and the military question whether his ouster from the dia has changed him   the whole experience seems to have made him bitter   said another former u s  official who worked with flynn and spoke on condition of anonymity  representative adam schiff  the senior democrat on the house intelligence committee  questioned flynn s temperament  saying trump needs someone more steady and  thorough in their analysis  to temper him    i m not sure that s what you get with general flynn  and i would be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive security adviser   schiff told cnn  former colleagues are alarmed by his adoption of trump s divisive campaign rhetoric   including leading chants of  lock her up   aimed at hillary clinton during the republican national convention and saying

manage their political contributions to support business friendly policy   click here for a graphic  tmsnrt rs   many companies active in u s  politics spread their political donations broadly on both sides of the aisle and consider multiple issues when deciding whom to support  but inconsistency between a company s environmental positions and its political giving may point up a need for better oversight  according to jon lukomnik  head of the investor responsibility research center institute    there really needs to be a process that looks at these issues     at c suite and board levels on a periodic basis   lukomnik said  the reuters review covered donations made during the  election cycle by the political action committees  pacs  of  of the biggest publicly traded u s  companies that signed obama s  american business act on climate change pledge  in   a public promise to enact climate friendly corporate policies and support strong climate change oversight like the global climate accord signed in paris  the review found that  of the  companies are funding the campaigns of lawmakers featured on a  climate deniers  list that was put together by organizing for action  a non

plan to combat climate change  some of those on the list dispute the label  denier  and describe themselves as climate change  skeptics   the list includes republican congressman kevin cramer of north dakota  an energy advisor to presidential candidate donald trump who once argued the earth was cooling not warming  and republican u s  senator jim inhofe of oklahoma  who last year held up a snowball on the senate floor as evidence global warming does not exist   the review found pepsico and dupont s political action committees gave about half or more of the money from their top donations in

taken donations from companies that signed the climate pledge  said companies tend to consider issues like tax policy  national security  and regulatory policy when picking who to support   as opposed to a single issue like the environment  he  like other lawmakers featured on the organizing for action  climate deniers  list  said the debate over climate change was not as clear cut as obama s allies depict it    it is not a black and white issue  like if you agree with obama you re enlightened  and if you don t you re in the dark   he said   it is more of a spectrum   a spokeswoman for senator chuck grassley of iowa  another lawmaker featured on the list  said he had  done more than almost any other member of congress to increase the use of clean energy  sources like wind and biofuels   but she added he was opposed to obama s climate change initiatives  like the clean power plan to curb carbon output  because he felt that it could hurt the competitiveness of u s

anything   that absolutely goes on   he said  the five companies reviewed by reuters that did not fund opponents to obama s climate change agenda either had no political action committee  like apple

says were likely purchased by russian entities during and after the  u s  presidential election   chief executive mark zuckerberg said the company  for the first time  would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on facebook  no matter whom they target   facebook will also demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements  a requirement

zuckerberg  broadcasting live on facebook from company headquarters in menlo park  california  said the changes would help address concerns that governments including russia are using facebook ads to meddle in other countries  elections  earlier this month  facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in russia spent    on   facebook ads promoting divisive messages in

on thursday that he wants to hear from facebook  alphabet inc s  googl o  google  twitter and others in public hearings    it will be important for the committee to scrutinize how rigorous facebook s internal investigation has been  to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did   schiff said in a statement  the political advertising changes represent a retreat for facebook  which for years has resisted calls from transparency advocates and academics for the regulation of political ads  the company has instead treated them like all commercial ads  in the days after the november  u s  election  zuckerberg said it was a  crazy idea  to think that misinformation on facebook swayed the vote toward president donald trump   senator mark warner  the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee  this month compared political ads on social media to the  wild  wild west  and said legislation might be needed to address them   the u s  federal election commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes to digital ads and considered whether to call facebook and other tech firms before the commission for a public hearing   facebook has grown to be the leading online platform for political ads because of its low costs and tools for targeting messages to narrow audiences   u s  political campaigns likely spent   million

government action   warner and another senator  democrat amy klobuchar  on thursday sent a letter to colleagues inviting them to be co sponsors of legislation they are writing that would formalize and expand the commitments zuckerberg made   the legislation  they wrote  would require digital platforms with  million or more users to maintain a publicly available file of all election related ads bought by people who spend more than     according to a copy of the letter seen by reuters   trevor potter  president of the pro transparency campaign legal center  said in a statement that his group would  carefully monitor facebook s implementation of this new policy   he said facebook  helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the  elections   in the past  facebook has argued that ad details had to remain confidential unless released by the advertisers  zuckerberg  who returned to work on thursday after a month of paternity leave  laid out other steps the company would take to prevent governments from using facebook to manipulate each other s elections   he said facebook would hire  additional people  expand partnerships with election commissions around the world  and adapt systems to help deter political bullying   facebook has not found an attempt at election meddling in germany  zuckerberg said  but he added that the company would continue to examine fake accounts that it has removed in advance of sunday s german national election    i don t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy  that s not what we stand for   zuckerberg said   facebook general counsel colin stretch said in a blog post on thursday that it was unusual for facebook to voluntarily turn over information to government authorities  as it was doing by giving u s

       " 'patrick henningsen  century wiretoday america will choose its next president  what can you say that hasn t already been said in this  the most over analyzed political contest in history no matter which side of this salacious vaudeville ticket you are on  everyone will agree this has been the most raucous and divisive contest in electoral history  no matter who wins today  half the nation will be in pain  not least of all the founding fathers who have been rolling in their graves for the last  months more than ever  america is a nation divided  an increasing number of people are now completely immersed in hyper active social media environments  and so it s very easy to get caught up in one s respective partisan echo chambers   our way is the best way    our side is right    the other side is bad for america    we are the true party of the people  etc   many individuals simply will not  venture off of their assigned party or pseudo ideological reservations  much less talk to anyone whose views seem to oppose theirs  in public  partisan americans will only huddle with those who share the same team colors  and in private each flees to his or her prefabricated partisan media outlet or social  networking group  this virtual political matrix is now systematically divided in this way  there is nothing in between   no middle ground  no real commons  and no respite from the onslaught of partisan media  herein lies the fundamental problem in  politics   and why the fall out from this election will be ongoing long after the results are announced tomorrow morning to make matters even worse  this election season has featured two highly flawed candidates in donald j trump and hillary clinton  many commentators contend that these are the two worst us presidential candidates ever  essentially it boils down to mickey mouse vs cruella de vil let s quickly profile the two candidates since the  s the clintons have been synonymous with one word  scandal  the  s was a dodgy decade for the first family  bill  monica  whitewater  the arkancide epidemic  and selling white house s lincoln bedroom for  grand a night  take your pick  none of this has helped hillary in terms of public trust  where she s polling even lower than donald trump  on top of all the old clinton baggage  you have two huge new scandals originating from her tenure as obama s secretary of state   including becoming the latest member of her family to lie under oath to congress  way to go bill   this time over hillary s private email server cover up  and multiple pay to play corruption allegations at the clinton foundation as result  hillary clinton embodies the avatar of cruella de vil  her campaign breaks down like this  fighting for woman and children if you support hillary clinton then you believe your candidate represents the ascendency of the female species  and especially all women who have been held back by the cruel customs of an american patriarchal society  you also recognize her brand  clinton  she s the wife of the  president of the united states  bill clinton  which leads you directly into the second half of the campaign pitch   she has the experience  having been around the white house for  years  since the beginning of her first campaign in   clinton the woman was the main identifier and the primary reason why she should be president  instead it was  the first black president   so she had to wait  years  at the age of   she s past her prime  but she d still be the first woman president and therefore  we re told   an inspiration to women everywhere  as the marketing slogan says  she is also the champion of all minorities  as well as the poor   which are also traditional democratic party staples  although the  poor point is hard to square  seeing that the clinton s have amassed a net worth in the hundreds of millions in the short space of  years   primarily by monetizing their time in public office through enormous speaking fees and scraping off expenses and lifestyle extras from their billion dollar foundation slush fund  a whole other scandal   regardless  her supporters see her as their champion  rallying around a familiar set of leftwing social issues  inequality redistribution of wealth  pro choice abortion  amnesty for undocumented illegal immigrants  and man made global warming climate change the novelty of trump is like no other before him  at first  it could be explained like this  for some strange reason  it s a tradition in america that a certain number of people each year will cast a write in vote for mickey mouse on their ballot  this is regarded as the ultimate protest vote   a vote for mickey is a vote against the establishment  so it should be no surprise that when he arrived on the electoral scene in june   his support base was already waiting for him   trump was their  year old   foot  inch   lbs mickey mouse trump s campaign breaks down like this  make america great again if you support trump  then you believe this is the story of a true underdog  the consummate outsider taking on the political elites   a man with absolutely no experience in political office  other than writing cheques for nearly all them   uncorrupted by corporate money  because he has his own  and shunned by the self serving political and media establishment who have done nothing for the country s working class and rapidly disappearing middle class  while some of this is true  as a reality tv icon  a billionaire property magnate and career playboy  trump is certainly no  man of the people  in the horatio alger sense  despite all that  judging by most major polls  nearly half of the united states population is behind him  to them  he is their champion  he ll lower taxes and bring back the jobs from overseas  rebuild the military  and most importantly  he doesn t want any money from corporate lobbyists  when crowds chant   drain the swamp   referring to washington dc  he s the man they want to hire to do that job  trump s response to them is simple   i only work for one special interest group  and that s you the american people   in this sense  trump has run the most unconventional political campaign ever love him or loath him  that message resonates and for good reason  the door to the cess pit is now open and many are horrified at what they see  through the incredible wikileaks podesta email trove  many americans have been able to peek inside the rude  incestuous and outright nasty elite political scene that controls washington dc  clinton was hit pretty hard by the wikileaks revelations  as was the already shaky credibility of the clinton foundation  this exposed a lot of the corruption around her and the party  also  ten days before the election fbi director james comey through a grenade into the clinton juggernaut by announcing the fbi would reopen hillary s email case because of data discovered through her chief aid huma abedin s estranged sex pest husband anthony weiner  this put a timely dent into clinton s lead  with the help of the us media though  she battled though it and emerged from that m l e although he faced much less in terms of real institutional corruption scandals  trump did not fair as well in public relations terms as clinton did  part of the reason for this was that trump and the establishment media are like chalk and cheese  he s too unconventional for the bland gatekeepers  one of the reasons media operatives hated trump was because he could generate his own gravity  and this posed a direct challenge to state oriented propaganda machines like cnn who are busy spoon feeding their own artificial version of reality to the american people  so  after a brief primary honeymoon  the media  aside from fox news  declared all out war on trump  with each passing week  he was hamstrung by an endless string of media traps  twitter gaffes and internal campaign tedium  dogged by the media and his opponents  trump couldn t hold his tongue or stay off of twitter  and so his retaliatory tirades turned into negative headlines  for intelligent pundits and moderate supporters  the constant gaffes and distractions made it almost impossible to consider donald trump as a serious candidate  to the casual observer  it would appear that the donald was nothing but a stalking horse for hillary the same could be said for democratic primary challenger bernie sanders  photo  left   up until the moment he entered the contest in july   party favorite hillary clinton was essentially running unopposed  it s almost as if sanders was drafted into the race at the last minute in order to make it look like a real race  and then at an opportune moment   he would pledge his allegiance to the party favorite  that s exactly how it played out  early on sanders  chances were practically doa because of the democratic party s pre rigged  super delegate  system  still  he fought on and pulled bigger crowds than hillary  then the real bomb dropped when it was revealed through the democratic national committee  dnc  email leaks how party chairwoman debbie wasserman shultz along with party elites  conspired to railroad the bernie sanders campaign  that s right  bernie was shot down by his own party in order to make way for hillary s coronation  not very democratic of the democrats  wasserman shultz even resigned as a result  sanders didn t seem to mind  in public anyway  and voluntarily capitulated  and hillary enjoyed a steady climb afterwards  from this we can deduce that the clinton sanders contest was likely a contrived affair from the onset  although one wikileaks email shows that sanders may even have been blackmailed into bowing down to clinton  it seems that the dnc and clinton never expected sanders to capture the imagination of the nation s youth like he did  which also speaks volumes about the acute lack of enthusiasm for clinton s white house run   even within her own party  sanders was a rock star  clinton was a pop star  that s a big difference in the eyes of millennials who place a lot of value on authenticity then came the debates  the first one broke all ratings records for a political debate with an estimated near  million total viewers  it was gladiator meets jerry springer  then the new york times leaked some of trump s tax returns and the media had a field day  later in october  a barrage of bombshells would besiege the trump campaign  one after another  ranging from allegations of groping on a first class flight in the  s  to a porn star upset over trump s manly advances   each of them suddenly appearing in the media right before the election to complain about being sexually harassed by trump  after the first debate  a rather lurid  leaked off the record audio conversation from access hollywood in  appeared which nearly upended his campaign  immediately followed by a new string of women coming forward with more allegations sexual abuse  this devastated trump in the polls  and became the  hour obsession for democratic party linked networks like cnn and msnbc  amazingly  every one of the accusers has since disappeared from the scene  the damage was done though  and this became the basis for the clinton campaign  her tv ads and her surrogates  anti trump message   just like with hillary s podesta emails  it was non stop media chaos  the attacks and counter attacks were many   too many to mention here somehow  he crawled out of that pit and rebounded in the polls trump was also being attacked in the media for proffering that the  system is rigged   in all seriousness  does anyone not believe this  still  critics have called this  extremist  rhetoric from trump  from a media standpoint however  america s democracy is rigged   and clearly in favor of the democratic party  wikileaks proved through the release of clinton campaign chair john podesta s emails   starting with the corruption between dnc acting chair donna brazile who cheated the debate process by passing questions from the network cnn   directly to hillary clinton  if that wasn t bad enough  it was later revealed how the dnc tried to provide cnn anchor wolf blizter with questions to ask donald trump  and how dnc staffers offered cnn s jake tapper questions to ask during another interview on the network  cnn s chief political correspondent gloria borger was also exposed as one of many so called  journalists  in private contact with the clinton campaign  the online journal politico s editor glenn thrush was also caught stage managing coverage with the clinton campaign  as yet  none of these media operatives have been fired  or have resigned   which says a lot about the corrupt culture of the mainstream media in the united states today  there were many other incidents covered by wikileaks  too many to list here  total collusion between the so called  press  and the democratic party  so  yes  the system is rigged  this is no longer debatable  and the fact that the public now understand this should haunt media operative long after this election  when they go low  we go high while this election may have been bad for the american people  it s been great for one groups of insiders  elite advertising agencies and the tv networks who sell ad space to the campaigns  the clinton campaign combined with the pro clinton super pacs spent upwards of   million on tv ads   the majority of which were negative ads characterizing her competitor as a racist xenophobic womanizing misogynist  by doing so  the clinton campaign and the democratic party effectively made their pitch to voters as a referendum on political correctness  in other words   we can t allow this disgusting human being to win this election   the other big clinton tv ad buy was   we can t let donald trump get his hands on the nuclear codes   this ad was based on the ridiculous premise that a us president could just walk into the oval office one day and start launching icbm warheads around the world for no reason   a completely bogus thesis if there ever was one  but apparently the campaign thought the public was stupid enough to believe this fictional scenario   as result of the all the negative campaigning  clinton spent very little if any  substantial time speaking or debating the details of domestic issues and her chequered foreign policy record  particularly regarding the horrendous failures of libya and syria  instead  on numerous occasions  especially during the debates  she would refer people to  my website    as if that s what people really wanted  normally  people want to hear it from the candidates mouth  but the internet has offered a nice respite for politicians who prefer not to get tangled in discussing real issues in the flesh it should be noted that from the beginning  the gender argument has been pervasive in all clinton messaging  almost to the point of entitlement   it s about time for woman to become president  we re going to make history with the first woman in the white house   for many americans  however  this message based purely on identity politics tends to push discussion of the candidate s  credentials and policies to the background  it is also used to fend of any criticism or inquiry into policy specifics  not surprisingly  clinton has mostly steered away from specifics or making any promises   unlike her predecessor obama did when he promised everything imaginable for his first   days  in order to attract votes  including closing the offshore eyesore  guantanamo bay prison  and bringing the troops home from iraq on his first day  none of this actually happened  which fuelled a lot of disenchantment and skepticism from younger voters this time around  clinton s gender platform has also been augmented by a racial plank  and the campaign constantly reminds its supporters that blacks and other ethnic minorities should have common cause with women  inferring that their liberal cohorts have also been held back by the cruel customs of a white male dominated  anglo saxon patriarchal society  in  democrats have also reintroduced the topic of slavery as a major talking point  resulting in even more tension  clinton s slogan is  stronger together  but one could argue that it s possible the democratic party s obsession with promoting identity politics has done more to foster new political and social divisions  and subdivisions   rather than to unite all of society under a common national identity  this is a debate which should happen  but few dare to challenge the political left on that issue  some food for thought  a recent rasmussen poll concluded that race relations in the us have deteriorated under president obama  the highest dissatisfaction mark since he was elected eight years ago   up  points since   why have  race relations  gone down hill  this poll result appeared for a reason  and it s probably not just because white america was upset they elected a black president in   although this is what democrats insist when you show them this particular poll  it could also be related to the caustic  relentless confrontational identity politics agenda being pushed by  agents of change  in the new radical left  or maybe it simply reflects a fundamental failure of a political leadership which only panders to its own side of the aisle   and shuns the other  america will remain divided unless both democrats and republicans   liberals  and  conservatives  can figure one how to overcome this flaw although bill might be his wife s greatest asset  he is also her biggest achilles heal  hillary has built her entire political career on the back her two term husband   with the former first lady slipping seamlessly into brand clinton and a ready made political legacy  after hillary unleashed the misogynist card on trump  bill soon came under fire over his own sordid history of sexual deviance  after that  bill was used sparingly in pubic  instead  the clinton camp relied heavily on the white house to do its campaigning for them  as a result  the first lady  michelle obama and the president did many of the big campaign stops in hillary s absence  collectively  it seemed as if hillary s vip surrogates did more campaigning than she did herself  multimillionaire celebrity surrogates lined up to stump for hillary  including katie perry  image  above   bruce springsteen  bon jovi  robert deniro  jennifer lopez  madonna  leonardo dicaprio  lady gaga  miley cyrus  jay z  beyonce and even lebron james looking cool with the kids  so clinton is being backed by the billionaire hollywood entertainment wing of the establishment even with all of that celebrity power though  trump still attracted vastly bigger crowds on his own  but how  why would a minimum of   at every stop turn out just for trump with more than a touch of irony  the one person who articulated this phenomenon better than anyone else was a radical left wing icon  filmmaker michael moore  he recently filmed a one man show entitled trumpland where moore s said this  i know a lot of people in michigan that are planning to vote for trump and they don t necessarily like him that much  and they don t necessarily agree with him  they re not racist or rednecks  they re actually pretty decent people  and so after talking to a number of them i wanted to write this donald trump came to the detroit economic club and stood there in front of ford motor executives and said   if you close these factories as you re planning to do in detroit and build them in mexico  i m going to put a   tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody s going to buy them   it was an amazing thing to see  no politician  republican or democrat  had ever said anything like that to these executives  and it was music to the ears of people in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania and wisconsin   the  brexit  states  you live here in ohio  you know what i m talking about  whether trump means it or not  is kind of irrelevant because he s saying the things to people who are hurting  and that s why every beaten down  nameless  forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves trump  he is the human molotov cocktail that they ve been waiting for  the human hand grande that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them and on november   election day  although they lost their jobs  although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank  and next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone  the car s been repoed  they haven t had a real vacation in years  they re stuck with the shitty obamacare bronze plan where you can t even get a fucking percocet  they ve essentially lost everything they had  except one thing   the one thing that doesn t cost them a cent  and is guaranteed to them by the american constitution  the right to vote  they might be penniless  they might be homeless  they might be fucked over and fucked up it doesn t matter  because it s equalized on that day   a millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job  one  and there s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class so on november   the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth  be handed a ballot  close the curtain  and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking x in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives  donald j  trump  they see that the elite who ruined their lives hate trump  corporate america hates trump  wall street hates trump  the career politicians hate trump  the media hates trump  after they loved him and created him  and now hate  yes  on november   you joe blow  steve blow  bob blow  billy blow  all the blows get to go and blow up the whole goddamn system because it s your right  trump s election is going to be the biggest fuck ever recorded in human history and it will feel good  reading that  you can t help but feel that moore has some real anger issues  nonetheless  he inadvertently delivered the best pro trump speech of the election for many  including michael moore  trump might not be the ideal vehicle for such a profound movement  and yet  he is that vehicle granted  half of the american population have been conditioned to hate trump for various reasons  but many of them are missing the key point in the trump story  just like they did in the sanders story  trump offered millions of voters something profound  the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is washington dc  anything is still possible in american politics   where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class this concept should not be underestimated  it s a fundamental tenet of the american culture  as flawed an individual as he might be   at this moment in time  donald trump is the avatar who embodies this idea of opportunity and hope in today s political reality show and infotainment media environment  timing is everything and america loves a comeback  trump s late october surge in the polls certainly reflected that public sentiment and overall enthusiasm  trump has flown more miles and visited more cities than any other presidential candidate in memory   so he s not leaving much on the table in terms of energy  will this translate into votes in key swing states  we ll see sure  when it all started  donald trump was mickey mouse  but somewhere along the way  the novelty has transformed into a bona fide movement  the fact that trump  a candidate with zero political experience  bested a total of  other gop primary candidates   all of whom were seasoned  career politicians   revealed just how profoundly unpopular establishment party stalwarts are with the general electorate  no amount of tv advertising can gloss over this realty  what began as a  protest vote  for so many who no longer trust or feel any affinity with elite politicians  has since morphed into a powerful mandate for change trump s victory during the gop primaries was also historic   it signalled an outright rejection of the party establishment  of the constant banal republican bickering over who is the  most conservative   and the traditional construct of the polished politician  trump smashed all of this  he has done exactly as reagan did in the  s   he pole vaulted over a stiff  entrenched establishment   and took his message directly to the people on the democratic party slate  the exact same phenomenon unfolded  with candidate bernie sanders gathering tens of millions of anti establishment and anti war voters in the  months preceding the democratic party convention  in modern media terms sanders couldn t be any less appealing   with his unkept hair  the dandruff flaking off of the shoulders of his dodgy suit coats  and a semi hunchback look  his supporters couldn t care less  the legions of college aged students didn t seem to care about the looks or the lack of clintonesque cleverly scripted sound bites  sanders could rattle off facts and issues without a teleprompter  and he did it with genuine conviction   something clinton still struggles with  regarding the wars  as sanders rightly pointed out  unlike hillary clinton  he voted against the iraq war in   this also resonated with the grassroots base  additionally  unlike his opponent  sanders was not pandering to wall street and accepting large sums of money from elite financial interests to his base  sanders was the real deal   and for the same reasons that trump s base is still behind him  the political and media establishment have gone to great lengths to conceal this reality  but in doing so they are only delaying their eventual demise this is a long tail trend which is not going to reverse itself  and it s not confined to the us either   it s international  we saw this to some extent with the brexit vote this past summer which defied the political media establishment s version of consensus reality  political stalwarts and generational glad handers will try their hardest to ignore it  but it s a clear public mandate   away from the carefully controlled establishment model of politics  last year in britain  millions of voters shunned the labour party establishment and mainstream media favorites  and instead threw massive support behind the current labour leader jeremy corbyn  like sanders  corbyn is not a media poster boy  before this year  you d have been hard pressed to spot the aging corbyn clean shaven  or wearing a suit  much less a tie  this political shift confounded all of the  experts  and has triggered a tectonic shift in the labour party itself  as acolytes and devotees of former prime minister tony blair have all but thrown their toys out of their prams over the corbyn issue  like with sanders  the people gathered in droves behind a brazenly anti establishment and antiwar leader who was cast aside by the party establishment and media operatives in italy  a similar populist movement is well under way with the five star movement  originally launched in  by italian comedian and entertainer beppe grillo  five star are now in parliament  the term  five star  symbolizes five key issues for the party  public water  sustainable transport  sustainable development  right to internet access  and environmentalism  similarly  spain has recently seen the world s first crowd funded political party with podemos  translated  we can    this is the future as far as the lesser of two evils is concerned  the corruption issue weighs heavier with clinton  while trump s scandals derive from his private and business life  clinton s scandals are from her time in public office  and involve current and past democratic political operatives and appointees   and so they deserve more scrutiny and accountability as they were done on taxpayer time  and bound by supposed strict codes of conduct  in stead  the media has worked hard to equate various mini scandals from trump with the mega scandals of the clintons when clearly these are two different things  sp far  clinton seems to have been able to remain above the law   which has done a lot to fuel resentment against her  the white house and a highly politicized department of justice  on paper  america has a stark choice  donald trump seems to be an anti globalist  anti tpp  free market oriented  populist nationalist  hillary clinton seems to represent  equality for all   but more than that she represents the status quo  a continuation of barack obama and his failing obamacare legacy  an establishment elitist globalist agenda with a radical leftist bent but how much will either candidate s presidency actually resemble their campaigns if clinton wins you can expect a huge celebrity studded gala ball in washington dc  followed by  months of congressional hearings  indictments  impeach hearings and general gridlock  expect the usual cast of suspects in her cabinet  surrounded by all the usual insiders  expect bill to be named hillary s  economic tsar   in the democratic tradition  hillary will raise taxes and increase spending  this is why wall street loves clinton  and why she accepts their money   because like with obama  clinton s washington will certainly sink further into debt   and wall street profits from this debt  also  expect the clintons  net worth to sky rocket  still  with so many scandals already on the boiler  it will get ugly  and it will stay ugly  there will be gridlock well into   like obama did with the issue of  race   clinton will certainly make gender the defining issue of her presidency  as well as continue hammering home the idea that america has a  race  problem  the culture wars will continue and america will become a cultural marxist battleground  hillary clinton s america will be a sectarian america  so expect those rasmussen numbers to continue on their present trajectory  expect trump supporters to call foul on  vote rigging  too there will be some vote rigging  as there has been in many us elections  just this past week  there have been multiple cases of voter fraud in the us  and these are only the cases where people have actually been caught     with hillary  sooner than later  you can also expect an escalation of rhetoric and ill informed talk of  no fly zones  in syria and military a confrontation with russia  and possibly even iran  lots of wars and proxy wars  this is why the neocons love hillary if trumps wins  the mainstream media will be in a state of shock  followed by a state of panic  followed by a state of chaos  sure  trump may wish to unite america  but this is a near insurmountable task now after  years of sharpton obama political agitation and other artificial divisions constructed through hundreds of  progressive  front organizations funded by social engineers like billionaire george soros  if trump wins  expect the likes of soros and moveon org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs  who will protest  riot  smash and burn their way on to cnn s  hour news rotation  expect occupy    and  blacklivesmatter to rage  you can also be certain that clinton  the democrats and their media operatives at cnn  msnbc and others  will blame vladimir putin and the russians for hacking the us election in favor of trump  although trump may cut taxes  like reagan he will likely balloon federal spending  it is also unlikely trump will make any significant dent in the national debt which is currently hovering around   trillion  however  with trump  there is a chance to de escalate the aggressive posturing this current white house and hillary clinton have take against russia  this would be an important benefit of a trump presidency   a chance for a positive relationship between the us and russia regardless of which person wins  expect fbi director jim comey to resign after this election expect both candidates to prosecute their  war on isis   their  war on poverty   their  war on drugs  and their  war on domestic extremism  the election result is only the beginning  the real battle will take place afterwards expect a heavily divided and half bitter nation expect serious political party alternatives to emerge  building on the mild successes of the libertarian and green parties tomorrow  history will be made by either the outsider trump  or the insider clinton when you re talking about the outsiders though  whether it s trump  sanders  corbyn or grillo  no matter how pious or forthright  they will ultimately get caught in the gears of government  with all its trappings of nepotism and institutional corruption  the outsider eventually becomes the insider  resisting that pressure is the age old challenge to any reformer if there s one lesson to be learned by this year s us presidential race  it s certainly an old lesson by now  depending on what your view of communism is  karl marx is either a villain or a hero of social engineering  but he left us some interesting quotes  marx did get one thing right when he said   elections give the people the right every few years to choose which member of the ruling class will misrepresent them   it s still true today or as someone once said   no matter who you vote for the government always gets in  we ll see

refugee population regarding the flesh eating disease  leishmaniasis  plop warned in its latest report   we may be witnessing an epidemic of historic and unprecedented proportions  but it has largely been hidden due to lack of specific information  the plop journal reported leishmaniasis is now affecting hundreds of thousands of refugees and has spread to iraq  lebanon  jordan  libya and yemen  in yemen alone    new cases have been reported annually  the journal reported  additionally  the number of cases of cl  cutaneous leishmaniasis  has most likely been severely underreported  due in part to constraints on collecting data from violence torn regions  plop warned  few countries have mandated reporting of cl and the resultant weak reporting system promotes a lack of disease awareness and

the u s there are three main types of the disease  cutaneous  mucocutaneous  and visceral leishmaniasis cutaneous is the most common form among syrians  it manifests in skin sores that typically develop within a few weeks or months from a sand fly bite  the sores can initially appear as bumps or nodules and may evolve into volcano like ulcers mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin ulcers like the cutaneous form  as well as mucosal ulcers that usually damage the nose and mouth visceral leishmaniasis  which has also been found among syrian refugees  is the most serious form and can be fatal  it damages internal organs  usually the spleen and liver  and also affects bone marrow threat to u s  refugees who enter the u s  must undergo medical screening according to protocols established by the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc  each refugee must submit to a physical examination  including a skin test and possibly a chest x ray to check for tuberculosis as

cannot be detected upon physical examination if the patient is asymptomatic  as can be the case for years in december  dr  heather burke  an epidemiologist from the cdc s immigrant  refugee  and migrant health branch  explained to breitbart jerusalem that there is generally a window of three to six months from the initial physical examination until a refugee departs for the u s she said a medical examination is valid for six months  and explained that patients undergo a second examination just prior to departure   a quicker  fitness to fly  screening  while she conceded that this final examination is not thorough  she said it would pick up any visible skin lesions  burke told breitbart jerusalem that she is not aware of a single case of leishmaniasis entering the u s  via syrian

of california lawyer allan favish s case that government photographs of vincent foster s death scene be released for public viewing  the media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that foster committed suicide because he was depressed  but despite  years of denial by the major media  the foster case has not  closed    as the supreme court hearing wednesday demonstrated  the case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case  including a complete autopsy vince foster was not only deputy white house counsel but also the personal attorney to bill and hillary clinton on the night of foster s death  top clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his west wing office  in the days that followed  federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of foster s office and strange death since foster s july  death  the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of bill and hillary in the major media  but here s the undeniable truth there weren t  five  investigations into foster s death  as the media report  the park police  best known for their meter and horse patrols around washington  were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since president kennedy  the park police  contradicting standard procedure  declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry later  robert fiske  selected by clinton s counsel bernie nussbaum and janet reno  quickly confirmed the park police probe as a suicide but when ken starr entered the investigation  he reopened the case  his chief prosecutor in the case  miquel rodriguez  later quit the starr investigation  claiming that starr s staff was engaging in a cover up of foster s death rodriguez  a harvard educated federal prosecutor  argued that one of the polaroid photos taken of foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report  favish s suit before the supreme court is seeking to release this photo  among others no fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene  not a suicide a careful fbi microscopic investigation of foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them  though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded fort marcy park to where his body was found   years later  starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains  rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence   according to the fbi report on vince foster s death  below  blonde hairs were found on the body of vince foster  but were never investigated foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth  practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt foster was found with a  revolver no one in his family could claim  with two serial numbers  made from the parts of three or more guns  none of foster s fingerprints were found on the gun for years  detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a   colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in vince s hand the park police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage    and had no pedigree foster family members insisted neither foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver the ncic keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers on march     the fbi responded to requests made by a man names craig brinkley serial number   one of the numbers on the gun  was never searched  not by the fbi  the park police or by that  investigation  by ken starr serial number  was found on the frame of the gun  brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber that number was indeed searched by the park police  on the evening of foster s death  more exactly at   edt on july    interestingly  searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year  before foster s death  on march   march  and april  was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable the bullet from the gun that supposedly killed foster was never found  despite intensive searches despite claims to the contrary  no one who knew foster  including hillary  web hubbell and his own wife  saw signs of depression a so called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after foster s death  the note was torn into  pieces  yet an fbi examination found no trace of foster s fingerprints on the note and a top oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery despite the enormity of the case  foster s autopsy lasted an astounding  minutes  the coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders all of the x rays taken during the autopsy are missing complete crime scene photos don t exist  the park police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed  a series of close up polaroids  which favish is suing for  remain  this is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case  two new york homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out despite overwhelming evidence of a cover up  the media won t question the official ruling ken starr  who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the clintons during his  intensive  probe  confirmed a ruling of suicide  starr even hired o j  simpson s defense expert to prove his case on august     the daily mail revealed that fbi agents  reported interviews documenting that hillary clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor vince foster in front of white house aides triggered the suicide of vince foster were missing from where they should be filed at the national archives on the first visit  archivist david paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the fbi reports of interviews conducted by fbi agents on foster s death  on a second visit  archivist james mathis provided what he said were those same documents while the box contained dozens of fbi reports concerning foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner  u s  park police officers  and white house aides about the contents of foster s office    the reports on hillary clinton s role in his death were absent after filing a freedom of information request with the national archives  martha murphy  the archives  public liaison  reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant fbi files

       " 'london  reuters    british lawmakers will debate legislation underpinning the government s plan to leave the european union this week  the latest stage in an arduous journey through parliament  the first two days of debate in the current stage of the process will be held in parliament on nov   and   a total of eight days of debate are planned during this  committee stage   used to make changes to the government s proposed wording of the bill  formally known as the european union  withdrawal  bill  the legislation will then face several more stages of approval in the lower house of parliament  and must also make its way through a multi stage process in the upper house  both chambers must agree on the wording before it can become law  what is the bill and what does it do  the legislation serves two main functions    repealing the  european communities act which made britain a member of the european communities  forerunner to the european union  this effectively ends britain s eu membership    transferring the existing body of eu law into british law  this is designed to provide legal certainty about the complex process of leaving   why is it controversial  the bill has faced criticism from opposition lawmakers  campaign groups and members of may s conservative party  brexit is still divisive in britain after a referendum in june last year  and many people  including some lawmakers  want to retain as much of the country s current eu membership as possible  others would like to reverse the vote  may runs a minority government  which has a slim  seat working majority in the  seat parliament thanks to a deal with a small northern irish party   a rebellion of seven or more conservative lawmakers could see her lose a vote in parliament and forced into making concessions  the objections are mainly based on two themes    the power for the government to amend eu laws as they are brought onto the british statute book  these are often referred to as  henry viii  powers after the  century english monarch who ruled by proclamation  the government says it needs to be able to fix the wording of laws to ensure they work correctly after brexit  for example  where a law refers to an eu institution which will no longer have jurisdiction in britain  the law must be changed to point to the correct british equivalent   critics say the bill gives ministers too much power to make changes  and creates the potential for policy shifts to be implemented without full parliamentary scrutiny  the process through which the government would make the changes already exists and is known as  secondary legislation   it does allow for some degree of scrutiny by lawmakers  but would not submit changes to the full legislative process     the bill does not contain a provision for parliament to vote on the final brexit deal  the government has promised lawmakers they will get a  meaningful vote  on the outcome of negotiations in brussels to decide the terms of britain s exit and its future relationship with the bloc  as it currently stands  this vote will be on whether to accept the terms of the deal  or reject it and walk away without a deal  but critics says the promise of a vote should be written into the bill  some also say that it should give lawmakers more options than the current  take it or leave it  vote  this could mean an option to send britain back to the negotiating table  what has happened so far  the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in september when  after two days of debate  lawmakers voted  to  in favor of the principles of the bill   although the government won the vote  several conservatives indicated they were unhappy with the details of it  and said they wanted to see concessions during the next

time since taking power a week ago  speculation has been rife that he is close to lifting sanctions imposed by then president barack obama over moscow s annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula in   such a move would likely cause consternation among european allies as well as many in the u s  congress who are also troubled by russia s intervention in the syrian civil war and by u s  intelligence agencies  finding that moscow meddled in the u s  election campaign   as far as the sanctions   it is  very early to be talking about that   trump said  while insisting that he wanted to follow through on his campaign pledge to pursue better relations with russia  his caution on the russian sanctions came in response to a question at a joint news conference at the white house with may  the first foreign leader to visit the president since his inauguration  may made clear britain wants to continue sanctions until putin carries out the requirements in a ceasefire agreement arranged in minsk  belarus  in   this view is shared by european allies who fear putin could become more expansionist if he feels trump will not intervene   we believe the sanctions should continue until we see the minsk agreement fully implemented  and we ve been continuing to argue that inside the european union   may said  the boisterous trump and reserved may took pains to demonstrate a readiness to

willingness to dispense with formality that helped him win the nov   election  registering his displeasure when a british reporter asked him what he had to say to those who are  worried about you becoming the leader of the free world    this was your choice of a question   trump said with a half smile  then  nodding toward may as laughter erupted  he added   there goes that relationship   on

including hezbollah have this year seized most of the central desert from the group  and are advancing eastwards to relieve the army s besieged enclave in deir al zor   the coalition strikes to block the convoy moving into islamic state territory took place east of humeima  near the edge of land held by the syrian government  coalition spokesman ryan dillon told reuters    we did crater the road and destroyed a small bridge to prevent this convoy from moving further east   dillon told reuters by phone  he later said the coalition had struck vehicles containing islamic state fighters that were heading to that area from deeper inside the territory they control to the east  he did not know if the evacuation convoy  which contains buses of fighters and their family members  as well as ambulances carrying wounded fighters  was now in islamic state or syrian government territory    on tuesday morning a hezbollah run military media unit reported the convoy had reached an exchange point into islamic state territory  the evacuation deal also involved islamic state revealing the fate of nine lebanese soldiers it took captive in its border enclave in   and surrendering hezbollah and syrian army prisoners and bodies in east syria  the commander in the pro assad military alliance said it was considering an alternative location for the convoy to cross into islamic state territory    now things are moving to change the place from humeima and head north towards sukhna   the commander said    we re not bound by these agreements   dillon said  apparently referring to the ceasefire deal   they re clearly fighters and they re moving to another location to fight yet again   in accordance with the law of armed conflict     we will strike them if we are able to do so   he said  adding that direct strikes on the convoy would only take place if the militants could be separated from civilians  brett mcgurk  the u s  envoy to the coalition  criticized the evacuation deal in a statement early on wednesday before the strikes were reported  saying   relocating terrorists from one place to another for someone else to deal with is not a lasting solution   separately  the leader of hezbollah  sayyed hassan nasrallah  defended the lebanese group s involvement in the evacuation deal in a statement responding to criticism of the move from iraqi prime minister haider al abadi  abadi said on tuesday   transporting this number of terrorists from long distance to eastern syria adjacent to iraqi borders is unacceptable   nasrallah said it was a hezbollah deal agreed upon by the syrian leadership  that the fighters were few in number  and were being moved from one front hezbollah was fighting in to another  lebanon is a major recipient of u s  and british military aid  it says its offensive against islamic state last week was separate to the simultaneous one made against the same pocket from inside syria by the syrian army and hezbollah  regarded by the u s  and britain as a terrorist group   on wednesday the lebanese army said its head general joseph aoun had been phoned by the commander of u s  central command joseph votel congratulating him on the offensive and pledging to continue arming lebanon s army',\n",

       " 'shawn helton   century wirein the wake of the distributed denial of service  ddos  attacks that targeted many online companies and news agencies last week such as amazon  netflix  cnn and the new york times  we learned that the threat intelligence firm flashpoint assumed the lead public relations role in the media after the event   just as they did following the highly suspicious pulse nightclub shooting in orlando this past the summer  flashpoint is said to be investigating the nature of the alleged  hacker ddos attacks against the networks of the internet traffic management company dyn and many others just days ago later in this report  we ll focus our attention on the uncanny ties between the firm flashpoint  the orlando shooting and the massive internet related outage this past week but first things first  let s review elements of the recent ddos attack in america   cyber games    the ddos attack story falls in line with a designer western political agenda   photo illustration  s shawn helton on october   the technology blog engadget discussed the cyber attacks that led to an internet outage across america and other parts of the world  today s nation wide internet outage was enabled thanks to a mirai botnet that hacked into connected home devices  according to security intelligence company flashpoint  the distributed denial of service attack targeted dyn  a large domain name server  and took down twitter  spotify  reddit  the new york times  pinterest  paypal and other major websites  flashpoint has observed mirai attack commands issued against dyn infrastructure   flashpoint writes   analysts are still investigating the potential impact of this activity and it is not yet clear if other botnets are involved  the engadget article mentioned above  further explained that security experts had been prepping the public for an eventual mirai malware attack since its code open source was leaked  the author of the mirai malware made its code open source  and security experts have been warning of a possible large scale attack since this information came to light  in another media supplied back story the coming  launch  of mirai was discussed through the security based website managed by brian krebs  on krebsonsecurity   who ironically  have twice been the victim of cyber attacks over the years  the source code that powers the  internet of things   iot  botnet responsible for launching the historically large distributed denial of service  ddos  attack against krebsonsecurity last month has been publicly released  interestingly  according to bradley barth  a senior reporter for the it security online magazine sc  the mirai  supposedly leaked on september   contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain ip addresses such as the department of defense  dod   the us postal service and consumer giant general electric  ge  due to its coding  an imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits  including a hardcoded blacklist of ips that the adversary did not want to attack  perhaps in order to keep a low profile  some of these ips belonged to the department of defense  the u s  postal service and general electric  ge   though sc claims that the makers of mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile  the recent ddos attack attributed to the malware was as high profile as you can get   so this begs the question  what was the real reason the malware creators put an ip blockade on the dod  the postal service and ge is it possible the malware originated from whitehat hackers associated with the us government  or from a major us defense contractor like ge politico disclosed that the hacktivist avatar known as the  new world hackers  and anonymous  now a ubiquitous brand which could be anyone or anything  were responsible for the ddos attack on twitter and others  adding that  u s  officials preached caution  arguing there is still scant evidence to determine who is behind the attack  warning that both groups have falsely taken credit for high profile attacks in the past   flashpoint then declared that the group were  imposters   as the article then referenced obama s recent far fetched claims that russia is somehow  meddling  with us elections through proxy hackers   once again  without offering any definitive proof mainstream media pundits  including those at cnn  were also quick to dismiss the new world hackers as an  illegitimate group  who had  falsely taken credit for hacks in the past  less than  hours after the nationwide ddos cyberattack  former homeland security advisor to united states president george w  bush  fran townsend   left photo  reignited the ever popular blame russia  meme  as we predicted  in a cbs article  cbs news homeland security consultant fran townsend pointed to russia as a possible instigator  is this sort of a brushback pitch from the russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable   she said  townsend  also made the rounds on media after the bizarre anomaly ridden nice attack  pushing the mainstream narrative in our first report regarding the alleged hack on america  we discussed the ddos event and how it would be politicized by the media and us officials to blame russia  feeding into the false claims that the kremlin is somehow tampering with the  us elections  we also talked about how the incident might be used to push a newer and more restrictive stop online piracy act  sopa  and its senate doppelg nger  the protect ip act aka pipa   dual provisions aimed at restricting the use of copyrighted material on the internet  which could have vast implications on free speech  it is also important to reiterate that one of the main issues concerning the us government as the cyberspshere grows is isp  governance  which is code for making isp comply to any unlawful requests by federal authorities   including cutting internet access to individuals or organizations deemed to be  undesirable  by the state last week s choreographed cyber attack on popular websites and companies that allegedly spread through the mirai botnet malware via the internet of things  iot   has opened up another aspect of the story  this part of the narrative  appears to prey on the fears of the general public as iot devices have become increasingly connected  setting the stage for new security protocols and new cyber security products to be conveniently rolled out at any future date following a cyber crisis it should be mentioned that the security firm flashpoint was front and center  along with the internet performance company dyn    weighing in on the situation prior to any us intelligence agency making an official statement flashpoint operates as an intelligence watchdog  as well as an intelligence asset  in addition to playing a pr role for some recent large scale incidents   but who are they really   puzzle piece     the security firm flashpoint delves into the deep dark web for its clients  screen shot image source   flashpoint intel

and operations specialists  who  are fearlessly problem solving as we change the way organizations evaluate risk  the clandestine firm adds that their  premium business risk intelligence solutions afford superlative access and visibility into opaque areas of the internet  empowering our clients to defend themselves against various cyber and physical threats  while looking into flashpoint s investor section  we learn that the american venture capital firm greycroft partners is listed among those contributing to the security firm  it turns out that greycroft is also a large campaign

contributions to the clinton campaign are somewhat of a sidebar to the recent internet outage attack  it does represent another uncanny business and political connection that links a secretive firm  flashpoint  that appears to be taking a large role in steering the public s perception over certain incidents occurring in america  you have to wonder if this is really just a coincidence by this  we can see just how tight the elite inner circle is  with a small collective of corporate and media gatekeeper   and their political operatives   all carefully stage managing the narrative around almost

responsibility  for the shooting even though the purported shooter omar mateen was allegedly linked to isis the nbc report stated the following on june   flashpoint co founder evan kohlmann  an nbc terrorism analyst pointed out that even though mateen cited isis as the inspiration for the attack  al qaeda seemed to be claiming some responsibility because it has called for  lone wolf  attacks against the west  kohlmann said the statement   which lauded mateen as a heroic  lone jihad  holy warrior   appears to be an official inspire release  but he said it was far less professional than others  including one after the  boston marathon bombings that went to great lengths to praise the tsarnaev brothers  who said they learned to make their explosive devices from another inspire publication  the purported terror publication inspire has come under fire in recent years as some critics charge that the magazine may actually be a cia creation  something which is echoed through its ties to the dubious aqap terror operation during our summertime investigation into the suspicious events at the orlando pulse nightclub  we found evidence that omar mateen s worldwide security firm  was a client of the crisis staging company called crisis cast  the following is a passage from that report  truth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many

program  it was vague on many fronts  and did not change existing rules  but one objective  said trump aides  is to modify or replace the current lottery for h  visas with a merit based system that would restrict the visas to highly skilled workers  indian nationals are the largest group of h  recipients annually  such a change could affect companies  such as tata consultancy services ltd  cognizant tech solutions corp and infosys ltd  that connect u s  technology companies with thousands of foreign engineers and programmers  none responded to requests for comment  trump announced the order and made remarks at a visit to the headquarters of snap on inc  a tool maker in wisconsin  in addition to addressing the visas issue  he also ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring american companies to see if they are actually benefiting  especially the u s  steel industry   with this action  we are sending a powerful signal to the world  we re going to defend our

attract more people with advanced science and technology skills  atkinson said in a statement  but he said some ideas could make the system ineffective  such as requiring advertisement of job openings for long periods to prove the unavailability of u s  workers  democrats said trump s order was not strong enough  and too late  after thousands of visas were awarded this month in this year s lottery   for a president who has prided himself on his swift action when it comes to immigration  an interagency review of the program is a guarded and timid approach  it s too little  too late   said u s  senator dick durbin  the no  democrat in the senate  critics of the program say most h  visas are awarded for lower paid jobs at outsourcing firms  many based in india  that takes work away from americans  lowers wages and keeps americans from being trained in tech related fields  they say     right now  widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing american workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries   trump said  tech companies have been bracing for trump to make changes to the h  program  the visas are intended to go to foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge  such as science  engineering or computer programming  the government uses a lottery to award   visas yearly and randomly distributes another   to graduate student workers  critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower paid information technology workers       right now h  visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and that s wrong  instead  they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never  ever be used to replace americans   trump said  more than  percent of facebook inc s u s  employees in  used a temporary work visa  according to a reuters analysis of u s  labor department filings  facebook

       " 'new york washington  reuters    republicans generally agree that politicians should not enrich themselves while running the country  yet most think it is okay for president donald trump to do so   democrats largely support the idea of government run healthcare  but their support plummets when they learn that trump once backed the idea   at a time of already deep fissures among american voters on political  cultural and economic issues  trump further polarizes the public as soon as he wades into the debate  according to the results of a reuters ipsos poll  the poll suggests any effort to reach a consensus on key policy issues could be complicated simply by trump s involvement   the survey from feb   to march  of nearly   people asked respondents to consider a series of statements trump has made on taxes  crime and the news media  among other issues  in many cases  the data showed that people will orient their opinions according to what they think of trump   republicans  for example  were more likely to criticize american exceptionalism   the notion that the united states holds a unique place in history   when told that trump once said it was insulting to other countries  they were more likely to agree that the country should install more nuclear weapons  and they were more supportive of government spending for infrastructure  when they knew that trump felt the same way   democrats moved in the opposite direction  they were less supportive of infrastructure spending  less critical of the judiciary and less likely to agree that urban crime was on the rise when they knew that those concerns were shared by trump    i m basically in disagreement with everything he says   said howard house    a democrat from jacksonville  florida  who took the poll   i ve almost closed my mind to the guy    trump is not the first president to polarize the public  a  poll by the washington post found that democrats appeared to favor legislative action when they thought it was then president bill clinton s idea  and a  survey by hart research associates showed that both positive and negative attitudes about the  affordable care act intensified when called by its other name  obamacare   but previous presidents were more popular than trump at this point  according to the gallup polling service  and they may have been better positioned to address the public divide because of it  gallup had trump at a  percent approval rating on tuesday  he was as low as  percent last week   that leaves trump facing a largely disapproving electorate  even as the white house signals that in the coming months it wants to pass a sweeping tax reform package  a large infrastructure plan  and perhaps try again to supplant the affordable care act   the white house said that trump has tried to reach out to those who did not support him during the campaign in an attempt to build political consensus    the door to the white house has been open to a variety of people who are willing to come to the table and have honest discussions with the president about the ways we can make our country better   a white house spokeswoman wrote in an email   the hyper partisan era of trump  poll respondents were split into two groups  each received nearly identical questions about statements trump has made in recent years  one group  however  was not told the statements came from trump   the poll then asked if people agreed or disagreed with those statements  in a few cases  trump made little to no impact on the answers  but most of the time the inclusion of his name changed the results   a series of questions about conflicts of interest produced the biggest swings   some  percent of republicans said it was okay if  an official  financially benefits from a government position  however  when a separate group was asked the same question with trump s name added in  more than twice as many republicans    percent   said it was okay   when interviewed afterward  some respondents said they knew they were making special exceptions for trump   susie stewart  a  year old healthcare worker from fort worth  texas  said it came down to trust  while most politicians should be forbidden from mixing their personal fortunes with government business  stewart  who voted for trump  said the president had earned the right to do so    he is a very intelligent man   stewart said   he s proved himself to be one hell of a manager  a builder  i think he has the business sense to do what s best for the country    on the other side of the political spectrum  house  the democrat from florida and a hillary clinton supporter  said he also made an exception for trump  but in this instance it meant that house disagreed with everything trump supported   if trump said the sky was blue   i m going to go outside and check   he said   it is impossible to say exactly what motivates people to answer a certain way in a political poll  said john bullock  an expert in partisanship at the university of texas at austin   some respondents may have looked past the question and answered in a way that they thought would support or oppose trump  bullock said   but he said it was also likely that others simply have not thought deeply about the issue and are looking to trump as a guide for how to answer    they think of him either as a man who shares their values or someone who manifestly does not   bullock said',\n",

       " 'why do we even need a congress anymore  we have a king  and it appears the majority his council are there at his behest  in fact  why do we even need a constitution or elections  chief obamatrade proponent house ways and means committee chairman rep  paul ryan  r wi  admitted during congressional testimony on wednesday evening that despite tons of claims from him and other obamatrade supporters to the contrary  the process is highly secretive he also made a gaffe in his house rules committee testimony on par with former speaker rep  nancy pelosi s  d ca  push to pass obamacare  in which she said infamously said   we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it  it s declassified and made public once it s agreed to   ryan said of obamatrade in rules committee testimony on wednesday during questioning from rep  michael burgess  r tx  what ryan is trying to convince house republicans to do is vote for trade promotion authority  tpa  which would fast track at least three highly secretive trade deals specifically the trans pacific partnership  tpp   the trade in services agreement  tisa   and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  t tip  and potentially more deals right now  tisa and t tip text are completely secretive and unavailable for even members of congress to read while tpp text is available for members to review although they need to go to a secret room inside the capitol where only members of congress and certain staffers high level security clearances  who can only go when members are present  can read the bill ryan s exchange in which he made this gaffe came as burgess  who opposes obamatrade  and rules committee chairman rep  pete sessions  r tx     who stands with ryan supporting it  were discussing the secrecy of the deal with him  it came right after an incredible exchange where ryan attempted a ploy to try to save immigration provisions contained within the obamatrade package as a whole specifically tisa that were exposed by breitbart news earlier on wednesday  a problem for which he put forward a phony non solution designed to get more votes for his obamatrade agenda but not stop the immigration provisions  i would like to add and i stated this up front  that the gentleman mr  ryan worked well with not only myself but other members to address specific ideas  concerns  issues and you have done an outstanding job to make sure instead of saying   well that s not a problem  no i m not going to get into that   you ve bent over backwards mr  ryan   sessions said  i ve watched you do this and working with us  whether it be a request from the united states senate that was done on a bipartisan basis or whether it be one of our members  we have tried to work with those things  this  dr  burgess  this is why i can tout this agreement because we ve tried to go in whether it s the areas that i ve talked about foreign policy  dispute resolution  climate change  sovereignty  immigration  currency  transparency  fast track  presidential power and more that haven t previously been addressed we ve tried to thoughtfully articulate a good answer and mr  ryan has done that most favorably and i think his articulation today is evidence of his knowledge of those parameters therein  after sessions  pitch  burgess jumped back in to make another point  and i appreciate all of that but again  you read through this language down in the secret room and i welcome the day when people can read it  burgess said  before ryan cut him off  by the way  tpa it s declassified and made public once it s agreed to   ryan said what ryan is technically referring to is that tpp will become public if tpa is agreed to but congress will lose much of its ability to have oversight over and influence on the process  since tpp is  in many respects  already negotiated  it s  pages long  and on fast track  congress will only get an up or down vote and won t be able to offer amendments  the senate vote threshold also drops down to a simple majority rather than normally having a  vote threshold  or in the case of treaties  a  vote threshold burgess then moved forward with his point  but this is really tough sledding and it s not an area where i have a lot of familiarity and i m sorry   burgess said   the language as its written looks to me as if it is something that could be exploited  i appreciate all the safeguards you ve tried to put in place  and with this administration you can leave no stone unturned as far as putting in safeguards but i m not convinced that we again i can t get into the specifics of what i ve read because of the agreement that i signed downstairs but it concerns me and i ll just leave it at that and i ll yield back  sessions then jumped in to say he and ryan are available to answer any questions about this matter whenever anyone wants yet sessions  committee staff is publicly refusing to answer any detailed questions from breitbart news on obamatrade at this time  i thank the gentleman   sessions said    in fact the gentleman  mr  levin is correct there will be some changes that have to go back to the united states senate but i would like to say with great confidence to my dear friend the gentleman from lewisville  texas  that if you still have reservations from your reading of anything i would encourage you to engage the gentleman mr  ryan or myself  dr  burgess  any time you d like  i m available  mr  ryan s available  we ve made ourselves available with specifics on the same level  burgess noted how the process seeking fast track in the bush administration was much more transparent than it is now  thank you mr  chairman  i promised to be on my best behavior today and i am really trying it took a long time for me to even be able to see the agreement down in the secret room even though i was willing to sign the release that said i wouldn t talk about it  it took me a long time to get an audience with the u s  trade representative   burgess said   it should not have done that  ten years ago we did cafta  central american free trade agreement   sen  rob portman  r oh   was in my office he lived there  i couldn t get rid of him  this time  i couldn t get a it was an act of congress literally to get him to come and talk to my subcommittee on energy and commerce  which is the subcommittee of commerce  manufacturing and trade  that s how difficult this has been  so please i thank you for the work you ve done in trying to make this an open and fair process but my confidence in this administration has been and remains at an all time low and i appreciate what we ve heard today but i can t tell you that i m mollified by ryan then interrupted burgess again to argue that his concerns over the secrecy are why republicans should relent and support obamatrade  all i would say is all the more reason to pass tpa   ryan said   first of all  yes this administration is different and i can jump on the bash bandwagon better than anybody else as far as how they conduct themselves  via  matthew boyle  breitbart news',\n",

wanted to dismiss comey  he said that though he was personally fond of comey   i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader  the justice department on friday issued a transcript of rosenstein s remarks opening statement good afternoon  i welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of fbi director james comey  although i know you understand that i will not discuss the special counsel s ongoing investigation  most importantly  i want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation  there never has been  and never will be  any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the united states department of justice before i discuss the events of the past two weeks  i want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former director comey  i have known jim comey since approximately   in   when mr  comey was deputy attorney general  he participated in selecting me to serve as a u s  attorney  as a federal prosecutor  he was a role model  his speeches about leadership and public service inspired me on july     director comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of secretary clinton s emails  at the start of the press conference  the director stated that he had  not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the department of justice   they do not know what i am about to say  director comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose  what we did  what we found  and what we are recommending to the department of justice   he proceeded to disclose details about the evidence  assert that the american people  deserve  to know details  declare that no  reasonable  prosecutor would file charges  and criticize secretary clinton i thought the july  press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the department of justice and secretary clinton  it explicitly usurped the role of the attorney general  the deputy attorney general and the entire department of justice  it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions  and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election there are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized  such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors  and protect the rights of citizens director comey attended the maryland u s  attorney s office training seminar on october     and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the secretary clinton email investigation  i strongly disagreed with his analysis  but i believe that he made his decisions in good faith the next day  october   mr  comey sent his letter to the congress announcing that the fbi was reopening the clinton email investigation  he subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter  i completely disagree  he again usurped the authority of the department of justice  by sending the letter over the objection of the department of justice  flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions  and guaranteed that some people would accuse the fbi of interfering in the election before the senate judiciary committee on may     director comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation  i strongly disagreed with his explanations  particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment  nonetheless  i respected him personally former department of justice officials from both political parties have criticized director comey s decisions  it was not just an isolated mistake  the series of public statements about the email investigation  in my opinion  departed from the proper role of the fbi director and damaged public confidence in the bureau and the department in one of my first meetings with then senator jeff sessions last winter  we discussed the need for new leadership at the fbi  among the concerns that i recall were to restore the credibility of the fbi  respect the established authority of the department of justice  limit public statements and eliminate leaks on may   i learned that president trump intended to remove director comey and sought my advice and input  notwithstanding my personal affection for director comey  i thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader i wrote a brief memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my longstanding concerns about director comey s public statements concerning the secretary clinton email investigation i chose the issues to include in my memorandum before finalizing the memorandum on may   i asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it  that attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the office of the deputy attorney general during multiple administrations  he was familiar with the issues  i informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove director comey  that i was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns  and that i wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate  he concurred with the points raised in my memorandum  i also asked several other career department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits my memorandum is not a legal brief  these are not issues of law my memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct  the inspector general will render his judgment about that issue in due course my memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for cause termination my memorandum is not a survey of fbi morale or performance my memorandum is not a press release it is a candid internal memorandum about the fbi director s public statements concerning a high profile criminal investigation i sent my signed memorandum to the attorney general after noon on tuesday  may  i wrote it  i believe it  i stand by it finally  i want to address the media claims that the fbi asked for additional resources for the investigation of russian interference in the  presidential election  i am not aware of any such request  moreover  i consulted my staff and acting fbi director andrew mccabe  and none of them recalls such a request end of transcriptthe white house has struggled since comey s firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision  trump said as recently as thursday that he acted on a  very strong  recommendation from rosenstein  but rosenstein made it clear to congress that he drafted his memo only after trump told him of his plans to dismiss the fbi director he said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a  statement of reasons  to justify the firing  but he added   i wrote it  i believe it  i stand by it  via  nbc

       " 'new york  reuters    investors looking for the u s  republican tax bill to prompt multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars and end the worst slide in the greenback in a decade may have to temper their hopes for a prolonged rebound  the plan  designed in part to give u s  multinationals a reason to repatriate the roughly    trillion in profits held by their foreign subsidiaries  would slash tax rates on such previously accumulated earnings  companies have been slow to recognize those profits on their balance sheets so they can avoid paying u s  corporate taxes  which stand at a rate of  percent    graphic  overseas cash stash   reut rs   the dollar is down roughly   percent so far this year against a basket of currencies  the greenback has suffered as the federal reserve has raised interest rates more slowly than expected and president donald trump has not been able to sign any major legislation into law   graphic  dollar rise during  tax holiday   reut rs   yet analysts say that even if the tax bill becomes law  the dollar may not benefit in the long term because the legislation gives companies little incentive to convert their foreign profits right away  at the same time  many large companies already have those profits in dollar denominated securities   the republicans  proposals differ from the last tax break on foreign profits  which global financial services company unicredit said brought roughly   billion to the united states  the bill president george w  bush signed in october  drastically reduced tax rates to   percent over a  month window and  along with aggressive tightening by the federal reserve  helped send the dollar nearly  percent higher the following year   this time  however  the republican bills before a conference committee would permanently change how u s  companies  foreign profits are taxed   the united states would no longer collect taxes on most future earnings a company makes beyond its borders  as a result  companies would have fewer incentives to bring previously accumulated foreign profits home quickly because rates are not scheduled to revert higher   up to   billion in foreign earnings could be repatriated over an indefinite period  according to td securities  while that could provide some boost to the dollar  repatriation will probably not be a significant ongoing factor in the    trillion global currency market  analysts said   it was a one off repatriation and mandatory in  so companies took advantage of it  and the dollar benefited from it   said mark mccormick  north american head of fx strategy at td securities in toronto   but this tax bill doesn t have that same urgency     so far  there is no final version of the tax bill  legislation passed by the house of representatives would allow companies to bring back foreign profits at a  percent repatriation tax rate  as opposed to the current  percent  over eight years  the senate bill  approved over the weekend  puts the rate at   percent   neither bill requires companies to convert foreign profits into dollars   prospects of a tax break on companies  foreign earnings and expectations of wider u s  budget deficits helped boost the dollar to its highest levels since  soon after trump s presidential victory in november    now that the tax bills have passed both houses of congress   dollar bulls have started banging their drums  again  analysts at unicredit said  however  they said this attitude is misguided because the vast majority of the earnings that companies will repatriate are probably already in dollar denominated securities in the united states    even a significant wave of repatriation might not lift the dollar directly  as some of the largest u s  corporations already hold a lot of cash in dollar denominated assets   said shaun osborne  chief fx strategist at scotiabank in toronto   in many cases  foreign profits are based in dollars held in accounts at u s  banks  yet are treated as overseas assets on a company s balance sheet  as a result  they are not recognized as u s  income and are therefore not subject to u s  taxes   the brookings institution  a non profit public policy organization based in washington  estimates that at the  u s  companies with the largest cash balances abroad   percent of foreign profits are held in u s  dollar denominated cash or equivalents  for example  microsoft corp noted in its annual report that as of june   roughly  percent of the cash and short term investments held by its foreign units was already invested in u s  dollar assets  despite some skepticism about u s  repatriation flows  some analysts say the dollar could get a short term boost   immediately after tax reform is passed  you re going to hear this giant sucking sound as money is heading home very quickly   said david woo  head of global rates and currencies research at bank of america merrill lynch  yet he does not expect a dollar rally to continue beyond the second quarter of   partly due to concerns about the tax plan s impact on the u s  fiscal deficit   over the long term  the dollar will probably continue to slide  said brian jacobsen  multi asset strategist at wells fargo asset management  the effects of the tax bill are already largely priced into the currency market  leaving little unexpected demand over the following  months  he said    we are positioning client portfolios for a little more dollar weakness   he said   not strength',\n",

       " 'patrick henningsen  century wirehere we go again  there seems to be no end to the escalation of tensions between north korea and the united states and its allies yesterday  pyongyang s state broadcaster came out declaring what it claims is another  successful test   this time with a hydrogen bomb  which they say could be mounted on to their still as yet nonexistent intercontinental ballistic missile  icbm  seizing the moment  state news anchor ri chun hee proudly announced that the test was a  perfect success   and symbolises the country s final step on the long road to attaining a  state nuclear force   all very exciting still  there has been no independent verification of the claim  but why let that get in the way of a promising international security crisis  kim jung un  looking at shiny objects  pointing  generally looking busy   north korea s alleged  test  is said to have happened just hours after pyongyang state run media released images of leader kim jong un  inspecting   looking  pointing  something which looks like it could be a hydrogen bomb  but no one is really sure we re also told that this was  ready to be placed on top of an icbm   however no one has actually seen a real operational icbm yet  that s kind of an important detail in this grand plot  but one which is routinely overlooked by legions of western mainstream  experts  on cnn and nbc  so far  the dprk only has a series of botched tests of their short range hwasong  rockets  glorified scud missiles  to show the world  still  the western media insist that this constitutes a potential threat to the us so confident was this mainstream media outlet  that they ve seemed to have hedged their bets on the authenticity of the dprk state claims  leaving the offending  h bomb  in quotes see also  north korea and the unintended consequences of trumpthis wouldn t be the first time north korea exaggerated its wmd credentials  last january they exaggerated claims of a successful  h bomb  test  despite their dodgy record  the western media  and politicians who are fed by defense contracts   are lapping up pyongyang s latest pig s breakfast whatever this latest test was  it s hardly an act of war  meanwhile  south korea wasted no time retaliating by showing off its new toys purchased out of its us dollar reserve account  launching multiple missiles for the cameras  seoul insists that it s ready to activate four terminal high altitude area defense  thaad  missile batteries  it also carried out a major joint drill  likely pre planned anyway  with f  fighter jets and surface to surface ballistic missiles  this posturing by south korea has excited the western media to no end  everyone is loving it  because nothing brings eye balls and ratings like a good crisis guardian reporter justin mccurry confirms  south korea has carried out a simulated attack on north korea s nuclear test site in a huge show of force in response to pyongyang s detonation of what it claims is a hydrogen bomb seoul has also approved the complete deployment of a us anti missile system in another sign that it intends to address north korean provocations with reminders of its own military firepower  while keeping the door open to dialogue  you can be certain that cnn absolutely loves this latest  crisis  too  wailing this morning  south korea strengthened the deployment of a controversial us made missile defense system and launched a huge show of military might on monday in response to north korea s hydrogen bomb test  naturally  not a word of condemnation from the western media about south korea s real provocations   broadcast in colour around the world how serious is the threat at the time of publishing this piece  members of the un security council are already convening emergency sessions about what to do next  in the final analysis  there will have to be some clear and present threat in order to justify some harsh response from the unsc can such a rational evaluation be made with so much theatre on both sides washington s un ambassador nikki haley gave a predictable hawkish speech claiming that   he is begging for war   of course haley is all too eager to oblige once again  western media outlets are treating claims by north korea s state run kcna media agency as  good as gold   ratings gold  that is  for the us  this latest move by north

fighting talk  are there any adults left in the room not to be outdone  here comes a  good cop   enter us defense secretary james  mad dog  mattis  who is still earning his nickname meant to resemble an unstable  rabid house pet  after his meeting with president trump and vice president mike pence on sunday  the mad dog  wearing a purple tie  the same colour as hillary s revolution   read his military decree on the white house lawn  we have many military options  and the president wanted to be briefed on each one of them  we made clear that we have the ability to defend ourselves and our allies  south korea and japan  from any attack  and our commitments among the allies are ironclad   said mattis what a relief  he sounds moderate compared to trump  but wait before exiting the podium  he said   we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country  namely north korea  but as i said  we have many options to do so  this is a unique breed of lunatic talking tough  and talking of  options  for  annihilating  a country  normal people would say this is an idiotic proposition because the fall out would be much worse than any of kim apocalyptic sabre rattling  all this looks very familiar  quite simply  what we are seeing here in washington is neoconservativism reasserting itself through one of its flagship planks   the preemptive strike  above all other military strategies  this is always the most favorable for the pentagon because it doesn t require any real justification or accountability for a preemptive action  all that s required is a sufficient amount of media fear mongering and political hype about  the threat we all face  and how  we must act    and then simply fire away and sift through the rubble  reforming the narrative afterwards  in the meantime  the ruling parties can call it a success  and claim that  many lives were saved by this valiant action  etc  it s clean and straightforward  albeit in the short term  but extremely messy in the long term as much as hawks in washington would love to test out their new toys right now  a conflagration is not likely to happen by the hand of the us in the pacific rim  there are too many powerful players in the immediate vicinity  south korea  japan  china  taiwan  philippines  and russia  too  and the fall out from any rash us led geopolitical pissing contest   surgical  or kinetic action could be detrimental to all parties  better to get someone else to start it for them  but that s not easy either there was a time when people had high hopes for mattis  he was affectionately referred to as the  warrior monk   with many fox news pundits drooling over his apparent sun tzu prowess  as was rumoured that he has actually read some historical books and was  really smart  and  really wise    apparently a rarity in washington military circles these days  but no matter how many books people think he s read about the peloponnesian wars  it s should be pretty clear by now that mattis  like his predecessor ash carter  is acting as kind of an executive sales rep for the military industrial complex  that s essentially what the position of defense secretary has become in america  it s a straightforward deal  you ll keep your job  as long as you do and say what s required to keep international tensions high at all times  this translates into profits  and shareholder dividends for industry stakeholders  if you re not with the program  then you ll have to tender your resignation  just ask chuck hagel what americans should really understand is that  the generals  with whom trump is so enamored  and who he trusts with all our bombs and silos   have left nothing but a string of military failures in their wake  between generals james mattis and major general h r  mcmaster  you have a collective  plus years and two of the worst military and foreign policy boondoggles in us history  afghanistan and iraq  underscored by successive failed  surges   add to these  a total defeat in syria  blowing billions of us taxpayer dollars on a proxy war that s arguably created a new generation of islamist extremists  although no one will admit it   impressive  isn t it  so why do the media continue to elevate the military brass  not every general is a good general  as with any other position or profession  some are good  and some are corrupt  and many are incompetent  or promoted for playing ball  general david petraeus  is a good example of this  the media can t get enough of him  he was  the architect of the surge  we re told  which means he was around when obama bush ordered up another   troops for iraq in a futile effort to fix what they broke  still  the media will bend over backwards in an almost worshipful mode whenever his name is mentioned  forgetting that petraeus was found guilty of the same crime for which half of america wanted hillary clinton locked up  despite bringing his name and his office into disrepute  petraeus  was rewarded board positions with mega wall street firms like kkr  and a perennial seat at bilderberg men like mattis  mcmaster and petraeus can  and will run rings around this president who has already signaled his weakness for those chevrons on the shoulder  and this president will happily defer everything to these men  should we be surprised if they keep getting it wrong let s just pray that they don t get it wrong with

pending an environmental review   this week  the u s  defence department said it was  actively  considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with south korea to allow seoul to build more powerful missiles   at the south s request  moon told u s  president donald trump in a telephone conversation on monday south korea also wants to build a nuclear powered submarine  presidential officials said   all of this could lead to further militarization of south korea   said yang uk  a senior research fellow at the korea defence and security forum  south korea  which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense  is already home to some   local soldiers and more than   u s  troops  the country  still technically at war with the north after the   korean war ended in a truce and not a peace treaty  has deployed the u s  built patriot missile defense system  as well as the terminal high altitude area defence  thaad  system  trump warned the north and its leader kim

bolstering defensive rather than offensive capabilities   said reed foster  a defense analyst for ihs jane s   i don t believe that there will be any significant altering of east asian procurement strategies  despite the rhetoric emanating from north korea  principally because for them the threat hasn t altered drastically   reed added  conservative lawmakers in seoul in recent days have even called for a  nuclear balance  on the peninsula  saying seoul should ask washington to redeploy u s  nuclear weapons if south korea is unable to develop its own  the united states withdrew nuclear weapons from south korea in   when the two koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free  in violation of that agreement as well as u n  security council resolutions  north korea has conducted five nuclear tests   now is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons   chung woo taik  floor leader of the main opposition liberty korea party  told reuters   north korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago   reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario  as that would undermine demands from seoul and washington for north korea to abandon its nuclear programs  for now  officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines  which allow seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at  km   miles   topped with a maximum  kg    pounds  warhead  south korea is less focused on increasing the flight range  as that could face opposition from neighbors including china  russia and japan  and the  km range limit covers all of north korea in any case  senior government officials said  rather  seoul wants to double the maximum payload to   kg or greater  powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the north  the officials said  that s still a fraction of the size of  the mother of all bombs   which the united states dropped on a suspected islamic state target in afghanistan in

in line with a plan put forward by the military last year to mainstream militant groups  according to sources familiar with the proposal  the milli muslim league party loyal to hafiz saeed   who the united states and india accuse of masterminding the  mumbai attacks that killed  people   won  percent of the votes in the contest for the seat vacated when prime minister nawaz sharif was removed from office by the supreme court in july  but the foray into politics by saeed s islamist charity appears to be following a blueprint that sharif himself rejected when the military proposed it in   according to three government officials and a retired former general briefed on the discussions  none of the sources interviewed for this article could say for sure if the mml s founding was the direct result of the military s plan  which was not discussed in meetings after sharif put it on ice last year  the mml denies its political ambitions were engineered by the military  the official army spokesman did not comment after queries were sent to his office about the mainstreaming plan and what happened to it  pakistan s powerful military has long been accused of fostering militant groups as proxy fighters opposing neighboring arch enemy india  a charge the army denies  three government officials and close sharif confidants with knowledge of the discussions said the military s powerful inter services intelligence agency  isi  presented proposals for  mainstreaming  some militant groups in a meeting last year  they said that sharif had opposed the  mainstreaming  plan  which senior military figures and some analysts see as a way of steering ultra religious groups away from violent jihad   we have to separate those elements who are peaceful from the elements who are picking up weapons   said retired lieutenant general amjad shuaib  adding that such groups should be  helped out to create a political structure  to come into the mainstream  the plan   which shuaib told reuters was shared with him by the then head of the isi    said those who were willing  should be encouraged to come into the mainstream politics of the country   he added that in his capacity as a retired senior military officer he unofficially spoke to hafiz saaed and another alleged militant about the plan  and they were receptive   shuaib later said his comments in the interview were taken out of context and were part of a broader discussion about deradicalization strategies  writing in a local newspaper on wednesday he said the report  maliciously attributed some statements to me

islamic law   god willing  we will come into the mainstream   our country right now needs patriotic people   khalil said  vowing to turn pakistan into a state government by strict islamic law  saeed s charity and khalil s ansar ul umma organization are both seen by the united states as fronts for militant groups the army has been accused of sponsoring  the military denies any policy of encouraging radical groups  still  hundreds of mml supporters  waving posters of saeed and demanding his release from house arrest  chanted  long live hafiz saeed  long live the pakistan army   at political rallies during the run up to the by election   anyone who is india s friend is a traitor  a traitor   went another campaign slogan  a reference to sharif s attempts to improve relations with long time foe india that was a source of tension with the military  both saeed and khalil are proponents of a strict interpretation of islam and have a history of supporting violence   each man was reportedly a signatory to al qaeda leader osama bin laden s  fatwa declaring war on the united states  they have since established religious groups that they say are unconnected to violence  though the united states maintains those groups are fronts for funneling money and fighters to militants targeting india  analyst khaled ahmed  who has researched saeed s jamaat ud dawa charity and its connections to the military  says the new political party is clearly an attempt by the generals to pursue an alternative to dismantling its militant proxies   one thing is the army wants these guys to survive   ahmed said   the other thing is that they want to also balance the politicians who are more and more inclined to normalize relations with india    the isi began pushing the political mainstreaming plan in   according to retired general shuaib  a former director of the army s military intelligence wing that is separate from the isi  he said the proposal was shared with him in writing by the then isi chief  adding that he himself had spoken with khalil as well as saeed in an unofficial capacity about the plan   fazlur rehman khalil was very positive  hafiz saeed was very positive   shuaib said   my conversation with them was just to confirm those things which i had been told by the isi and other people   the isi s main press liaison did not respond to written requests for comment  saeed has been under house arrest since january at his house in the eastern city of lahore  the united states has offered a   million reward for information leading to his conviction over the mumbai attacks

tense meetings over the issue  sharif wanted to completely dismantle groups like jud  disagreement on what to do about anti india proxy fighters was a major source of rancor with the military

       " 'century wire says it s no secret that the us mainstream media enforces a very tight party line when it comes to saying anything about israel  generally speaking  any criticism of the  jewish state  normally ends up in the editorial waste bin the reason for this should be academic by now  powerful israeli lobby exists in washington and with satellite branches across the us and canada  the lobby s attack apparatus regularly coordinate media incursions and smear campaigns against any publication or journalist who dares to break rank and criticize israel s appalling human rights record  endless violations of international law and flagrant ignorance of multiple un resolutions  it consists mainly of the following organizations  the anti defamation league  which devotes a large portion of its time and resources to defaming people it seeks to discredit   the quasi masonic organization and godfather of the jewish political attack organs b nai b rith international   and of course  the adl s ugly step child  the dubious  ngo  southern poverty law center  these organizations enforce their strict public relations code through a collection of tactics like threats and boycotts  including targeting a publication s advertisers and sponsors  or featuring a journalist  media pundit  author or academic on one of their many  hate lists   and by lobbing the standard charge of antisemitism against anyone who sounds remotely critical of israel and its many failings this week  david cole  a national legal director of the american civil liberties union  and faiz shakir national political director of the aclu  penned a piece  see article below  in jeff bezos s recently acquired deep state propaganda mill  the washington post  in their impassioned piece  they posed the question of whether or not the recent us legislation called the israel anti boycott act is moral in a modern democracy  or even legal for that matter  incredibly  this new pro israel law threatens fines and imprisonment to anyone who speaks of or campaigns to boycott  divest or sanction the israeli state for its many and sundry documented international crimes  the level of tyranny inherent in this new piece of legislation is breathtaking to say the least  simply put   it s a direct attack on the us first amendment  what s worse is that it s being orchestrated from outside of the united states by a foreign entity  the bill s target is the boycott  divestment and sanctions  bds  movement  which is a global campaign that applies economic and political pressure on israel to actually comply with international law  something the us government itself should also be doing   according to the authors  the new orwellian law would also make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at israel or its businesses called out by the united nations  the european union or any other  international governmental organization   at its core  this law would constitute an anathema to any modern republican or democratic concept  and yet  this is what the israeli lobby seeks to impose on the people of the united states  so far   us senators have lined up to support this bill  and not one member of congress has joined the aclu in denouncing it  on the israeli payroll  us senator tom cotton here s a fact that might be hard for some to swallow  but it s true  this law was only able to make it as far as it has because of the virtual stranglehold the lobby has on nearly every member of the us house and senate by way of lucrative campaign contributions to public officials by way of foreign lobbies like the american israel public affairs committee  aipac   and backed up by public and media pressure campaigns which  for those who have dared to step off the reservation  have ruined many a career in washington  this lop sided situation not only threatens us democratic interests at home  but it s also a serious threat to us national security  what this also demonstrates is how easily us senators will disregard the us constitution for a few hundred thousand dollars stuffed into their campaign bank accounts by a foreign lobby  you can see their financials here and here it s left many onlookers asking  what s going on at the amazon post  the article is certainly measured and very careful in its wording  but the fact that it was allowed to appear at all might indicate that the deep state is loosening its restrictions on speech on israeli issues in the us mainstream media  we hope this is the trend anyway  although maybe not if the adl  b nai b rith  and the splc have anything to say about it by far  this is the biggest attempt yet by israel at hijacking the us democratic system  albeit from within  if this bill passes  it will mark the near end of what remains of the sovereignty of the united states of america  that is no exaggeration here s the oped   by david cole and faiz shakirthe right to boycott has a long history in the united states  from the american revolution to martin luther king jr  s montgomery bus boycott to the campaign for divestment from businesses serving apartheid  south africa nowadays we celebrate those efforts  but precisely because boycotts are such a powerful form of expression  governments have long sought to interfere with them   from king george iii to the police in alabama  and now to the u s  congress the israel anti boycott act  legislation introduced in the senate by benjamin l  cardin  d md   and in the house by peter j  roskam  r ill    would make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at israel or its businesses called by the united nations  the european union or any other  international governmental organization   violations would be punishable by civil and criminal penalties of up to   million and  years in prison  the american civil liberties union  where we both work  takes no position for or against campaigns to boycott israel or any other foreign country  but since our organization s founding in   the aclu has defended the right to collective action  this bill threatens that right the israel anti boycott act is designed to stifle efforts to protest israel s settlement policies by boycotting businesses in israel and the occupied palestinian territories  the bill s particular target is the boycott  divestment and sanctions  bds  movement  a global campaign that seeks to apply economic and political pressure on israel to comply with international law whether one approves or disapproves of the bds movement itself  people should have a right to make up their own minds about it  americans engage in boycotts every day when they decide not to buy from companies whose practices they oppose  students have boycotted companies that sold clothing manufactured in sweatshops abroad  environmentalists have boycotted nestl  for its deforestation practices  by using their power in the marketplace  consumers can act collectively to express their political points of view  there is nothing illegal about such collective action  indeed  it is constitutionally protected in naacp v  claiborne hardware co   the supreme court in  upheld the right of naacp activists to hold a mass economic boycott of segregated businesses in mississippi  the court stated that the boycotters  exercise of their rights to  speech  assembly  and petition       to change a social order that had consistently treated them as second class citizens  rested  on the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values  this is not to say that all boycotters are automatically free speech heroes  indeed  bds advocates have themselves at times shut down israeli academics or speakers to the detriment of academic freedom  thus  it s understandable that free speech advocates might not immediately identify bds supporters as victims of censorship  but when government takes sides on a particular boycott and criminalizes those who engage in a boycott  it crosses a constitutional line cardin and other supporters argue that the israel anti boycott act targets only commercial activity  in fact  the bill threatens severe penalties against any business or individual who does not purchase goods from israeli companies operating in the occupied palestinian territories and who makes it clear   say by posting on twitter or facebook   that their reason for doing so is to support a u n   or e u  called boycott  that kind of penalty does not target commercial trade  it targets free speech and political beliefs  indeed  the bill would prohibit even the act of giving information to a u n  body about boycott activity directed at israel the bill s chilling effect would be dramatic   and that is no doubt its very purpose  but individuals  not the government  should have the right to decide whether to support boycotts against practices they oppose  neither individuals nor businesses should have to fear million dollar penalties  years in prison and felony convictions for expressing their opinions through collective action  as an organization  we take no sides on the israeli palestinian conflict  but regardless of the politics  we have and always will take a strong stand when government threatens our freedoms of speech and association  the first amendment demands no less see the original article at the

at the white house  save one exception  the war in afghanistan  more than a dozen interviews with current and former u s  officials familiar with the discussions reveal a president deeply frustrated with the lack of options to win the  year old war  described internally as  an eroding stalemate    the debate carries echoes of the same dilemma barack obama faced in   then  as now  odds are that trump will ultimately send more troops  current and former officials say   it s the least worst option   one former u s  official familiar with the discussions said  speaking on condition of anonymity  while acknowledging that with trump  a pullout cannot be completely ruled out  trump s defense secretary  retired marine corps general jim mattis  has had the authority for nearly two months to add thousands more troops to the roughly   there now  down from a peak of more than   in    army general john nicholson  commander of u s  forces in afghanistan  requested the troops back in february  but officials say mattis won t use his authority until he has buy in from trump for a strategic vision for america s longest war  beyond more troops for afghanistan  the strategy would aim to address militant safe havens across the border in pakistan  that too has become a divisive issue  with several members of trump s inner circle split on how hard to press islamabad  sources say that the discussions   which included a high level white house meeting on thursday   could drag out for the rest of the summer  blowing past a mid july deadline to present a war strategy to an increasingly impatient congress  after thursday s meeting  chaired by vice president mike pence  people familiar with the deliberations told reuters that a final decision did not appear imminent  pentagon officials have declined to comment on internal deliberations  the white house has also declined to comment ahead of a decision on the strategy  while u s  backed fighters are rolling back islamic state in iraq and syria  the same cannot be said of the fight against the taliban insurgency in afghanistan  u s  intelligence agencies have assessed that the conditions in afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year  even with a modest increase in military assistance from america and its allies  during a july  meeting in the white house situation room  trump said mattis and marine general joseph dunford  the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  might want to consider firing nicholson  who was picked by obama in  to lead the war effort and has earned the respect of afghan leaders    we aren t winning   trump told them  according to accounts of the conversation  but current and former officials say the frustration had been mounting for months   at least as far back as february  one former u s  official said the internal deliberations about afghanistan were not aimed  at creating a broad set of options for trump  shortly before mcmaster was due to present his plan to trump for approval ahead of the may nato summit  secretary of state rex tillerson declined to endorse it  saying trump was not being presented with options  the former official and another current official said   the lack of options meant that the only recommendation that was originally to be put forward to the president was essentially the status quo   the former official said  discounting the troop increase as any serious shift in strategy  but in the months since  the possibility of a full pull out has been repeatedly presented and refined along with a true  status quo  option in which no new troops are sent to afghanistan  but none are pulled out either  still  u s  defense leaders are not believed to be favoring those options  david sedney  a former pentagon policy advisor under the obama administration  said failure to prioritize afghanistan could replicate the mistakes by previous u s  presidents    we ve been ambivalent about afghanistan for the last  years and when you have an ambivalent policy  it fails   said sedney  now at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington  mcmaster  mattis  tillerson  dunford  nicholson and some u s  intelligence officials argue that refusing to commit more u s  forces to train  equip and in some cases support the afghan security forces would eventually result in the taliban retaking most of the country from the u s  backed government in kabul  trump s concerns about afghanistan are shared by some senior officials close to the president  including chief strategist steve bannon  who  officials say  is skeptical about the need for an increase in troops in afghanistan  divisions have also emerged within trump s administration on how much to pressure pakistan  and how quickly  in order to address militant safe havens blamed for helping prolong afghanistan s war  nicholson  mcmaster and lisa curtis  senior director for south and central asia at the national security council  favor taking a strong hand with pakistan to deal with taliban militants using that country as a base from which to plot attacks in afghanistan  current and former officials say  on the other side are state department officials and others at the pentagon  including dunford  who take a broader view of pakistan s strategic importance and are less convinced that harsh actions will secure more cooperation from islamabad  they said  pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militant safe havens on its territory   the trump administration is exploring a new approach toward pakistan  reuters has reported  potential responses under discussion include expanding u s  drone strikes  redirecting aid to pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading pakistan s status as a major non nato ally',\n",

trump follows through on a pledge to defang a powerful consumer finance watchdog  since he was sworn in january  democrat josh shapiro has built up his own consumer finance unit in preparation for when republican trump s officials take over the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   the unit is staffed with more than a dozen people and led by a former senior cfpb attorney  shapiro and this team have already filed cases against navient  navi o   a student loan servicer  which is accused of deceiving borrowers in order to drive up profits  and are leading a  state investigation into hacking at equifax  efx n   a consumer credit bureau   we re demonstrating a capacity to handle these big  complex consumer financial protection cases   shapiro told reuters  adding that attorneys general from both parties have asked about how they can  mimic our efforts   navient has said it operates within federal laws and rules on student loans  and has contested similar charges brought by the cfpb in court  an equifax spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation   but we remain focused on helping our customers  as well as their employees and consumers  to navigate this situation   shapiro expects his case load will grow  particularly now that trump has installed his budget director and fierce cfpb critic  mick mulvaney  as temporary chief of the agency  the press office at the office of management and budget  which is currently handling public relations for cfpb  said it was too early to comment on democratic attorneys  plans   however  of course we will carry out what we are statutorily obliged to enforce   spokesman john czwartacki said  created in the wake of the   financial crisis to crack down on predatory financial practices  the cfbp has long been criticized by republicans  including trump  who say it is far too powerful and burdens lenders with red tape   shapiro is part of a group of democratic attorneys general from powerful and large states such as california and new york who disagree with trump s call for financial deregulation     since trump s inauguration in january  those top law enforcement officials have sued the administration at least  times over its crackdown on immigration and dismantling of regulations across a range of areas from energy to education   when it comes to financial consumer protection state attorneys general wield an additional potentially powerful weapon  a little known provision of the  dodd frank law  which created the cfpb  gives them the authority to enforce the agency s rules and its broad ban on  unfair  deceptive and abusive  practices beyond state lines  states have rarely used those provisions while richard cordray  appointed by president barack obama and known for aggressively pursuing financial firms  was in charge of the watchdog  but with his departure last week  mulvaney freezing new rulemakings and hiring and a permanent successor expected to loosen the watchdog s regulation and enforcement  top attorneys in states such as pennsylvania and california say they are preparing to get more active   if we have to do this with just states that makes it more difficult but that doesn t make it impossible   said california attorney general xavier becerra  a democrat  one difficulty for states wanting to pursue federal enforcement cases and go after financial firms across state lines  is that  by law  they must notify the cfpb  said ori lev  consumer financial services partner at law firm mayer brown   if they proceed without the cfpb  blessing or if the agency changes its mind about a case  then the agency could challenge them in federal court  and they would most likely have to defer to the cfpb  said c  boyden gray  a founding partner of boyden gray   associates  who works with the conservative federalist society on tracking regulation  still  attorneys general have jurisdiction to sue institutions operating in their states under state consumer protection laws and they could join forces to pursue cases nationally  attorneys general contacted by reuters and the democratic attorneys general association  representing  officials  or nearly half the top state attorneys in the country  said they were prepared to take on more cases  washington attorney general bob ferguson said his office s consumer finance division now had  attorneys  compared with  four years ago    consequently  we are well positioned to use all the tools available to us to protect washingtonians if a new leader of the cfpb does not share director cordray s vigor for protecting consumers   the democrat said   before the consumer watchdog was created  states often took the lead in cases involving consumer lenders  as ohio s attorney general  cordray  for example  led the investigation of financial firms which precipitated the financial crisis  winning more than   billion in settlements for the state and its pension funds  consumer advocacy groups have generally applauded the work of both the cfpb and the states on consumer protections  but some republican attorneys general have sided with trump on the need to rein in the federal watchdog   in a nov   letter to trump  republican attorneys from west virginia  texas  alabama  arkansas and oklahoma said mulvaney would help curb  the cfpb s practice of overreaching regulation that harms the interests of consumers and small financial institutions   anticipating more state activity  maria earley  partner at the law firm reed smith  has been advising clients facing cfpb charges against stalling in hopes the watchdog will become more lenient under trump   you may want to litigate to run out the clock  but you re going to have six  seven  eight states who will start looking into you   earley said  adding she has settled three cfpb cases for clients since trump took office  reuters could not independently verify this number  michelle rogers  a partner with buckley sandler  said wall street may end up with increased regulatory complexity rather than relief as the state attorneys step in   they are more nimble than a big federal agency  they have their

the theory behind the burning  looting  and rioting that have transpired in recent months in baltimore and ferguson  and it also lays out the group s agenda on current news events like immigration reform  transgender activism  and the fables about the death of convicted criminal sandra bland that the group is spreading through the media the nascent black lives matter movement cannot claim that these statements were made by a few fringe members  the entire rant was orchestrated by black lives matter founder patrisee cullors  who can be seen in the video enthusiastically pumping her fist and shouting along with every incendiary statement nor is black lives matter a fringe group  they have been embraced and given fealty by the highest levels of the democratic power structure  cullors told a british interviewer   we re going into halls of power now  many of us are meeting with mayors or meeting with local government  some of us have met with president obama himself to talk about the demands  ms  cullors  name appears on white house visitor records last week  breitbart news exposed that convicted cop killer assata shakur is one of the heroes of the black lives matter founders

radical and revolutionary agenda revealed in black liver matter s scripted call and response at netroots nation  even though the horde of screamers is surrounded by cameras  there has been no public criticism of cullors and her folloers shouting  burn everything down   nor any calls for her to apologize for her group s offensive statements that media fail is unfortunate  because every american should hear who black lives matter is  what they stand for and what they want  in the group s own words guided transcript of what black lives matter said the group starts by pointing out that both leftist journalists like cnn s openly gay don lemon and mainstream racer baiting democrats like the reverend al sharpton and rev  jesse jackson are actually too moderate for them if i die in police custody do not let my parents talk to don lemon  al sharpton  jesse jackson or any of the motherfuckers that would destroy my name  let them know that my sisters got this then another activist links the group with the lgbtq political left  black lives matter was founded by cullors and two other women who self identify as queer the speaker makes reference to being called by  the name i choose  not the name i was given   a familiar demand for anyone who has followed the recent bruce  caitlyn  jenner controversy if i die in police custody say my name  say my name  the name that i chose  not the one i was given  if i die in police custody make sure that i m remembered  make sure my sisters are remembered  say their names  say their names  marsha p  johnson   unintelligible  say their names  say that black lives matter  black lives matter https   youtu be  p  johnson is name used by malcolm michaels  jr   a new york drag queen who died in  in a death ruled a suicide  johnson   michaels was not in police custody the group then turns to its pro illegal immigration position  two of black lives matter s founders head up pro illegal alien groups if i die in ice custody say i am not a criminal  stop funding prisons and detention centers  shut ice down and  unintelligible  jails and our prisons  not one more deportation the line about ending all deportations got huge applause and cheers from the netroots the group then begins to turn their screeched narrative into an emotional and paranoid attack on white people  in strident language  they shout their fear that  white supremacy  wants to kill black americans en masse if i die in police custody  know your silence helped kill me  white sumprecacy helped kill me  and my child is parentless now if i die in police custody know that i want to live  we want to live  we fight to live  black lives matter  all black lives matter then the mob makes a thinly veiled reference to sandra bland  a woman whose death the group has been exploiting and spreading false information and conspiracy theories about for several weeks bland s death in jail after she was arrested for assaulting a police officer was ruled a suicide  and an autopsy confirmed that suicide finding with physical evidence  the autopsy also revealed that bland had a large amount of marijuana in her system additionally  bland had made a previous suicide attempt  had spoken about depression in a video she d posted on social and during intake at the jail had written herself that she was  very depressed  that day  further  bland had had at least ten prior run ins with law enforcement that had resulted in numerous conviction and over    in outstanding fines despite the mountain of evidence about sandra bland s sad history  the black lives matter movement has continued to push the idea that bland was an activist who was the victim of murder by the police  they push this narrative at netroots with a series of calls to violent action if i die in police custody don t believe the hype  i was murdered  protect my family  indict the system  shut that shit down if i die in police custody  avenge my death  by any means necessary

is interrupted by netroots nation official as national journal reported in a story that mentions none of these calls to violent action netroots nation itself announced plans to work with black lives matter for its part  netroots declined to criticize the protest   although we wish the candidates had more time to respond to the issues  what happened today is reflective of an urgent moment that america is facing today   the group said in a statement   in   we re heading to st  louis  we plan to work with activists there just as we did in phoenix with local leaders  including the

drain the swamp  mantra echoed towards the tail end of his presidential run in fact  the optics of mnuchin s appointment  seems to strike at the heart of the sub prime mortgage backed security lending which led to the   banking crisis during the economic crash  extremely high risk subprime mortgage backed securities were crafted from bundled loans  a large amount of these types of mortgages were adjustable rate mortgages  where interests rates would be fixed for a certain number of years  eventually sky rocketing to astronomical increases  subsequently putting the burrower under water as the banks continued to sell these loans to investors  this was a critical aspect that led directly to the foreclosure crisis that swept across the nation in the aftermath of  according to an article

collateralized debt obligation  cdo  lost about half of its value between  and   source  this american life   and since the riskiest  and highest returning  cdos were comprised of subprime mortgages  they became worthless after the nationwide increase in loan defaults began  continuing  the article outlines how the hedge fund wall street casino made a fortune by packaging mortgages into bonds to sell to investors  after mbss hit the financial markets  they were reshaped into a wide variety of financial instruments with different amounts of risk  interest only derivatives divided the interest payments made on a mortgage among investors  if interest rates rise  the return is good  if rates fall and homeowners refinance  then the security loses value  in a bold and controversial move  the president elect s administration by way of mnuchin  is looking to derail the dodd frank act  which was put in place in  as a moderate buffer  if at all   to restrict the type of bank lending that led to the most recent financial crash in   however  naysayers of the  protective act  say it s much to soft on wall street  which is in need of tougher restrictions  as any new deregulation could be seen as an attempt to increase the coffers of larger investment banks in the passage below  the new american expands on this idea through revelations released by the ny times  according to the text of the  dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the law is supposed  to promote the financial stability of the united states by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system  to end  too big to fail    and  to protect the american taxpayer by ending bailouts  however  as is usually the case with federal laws  dodd frank does precisely the opposite   in fact   reports the new york times  gretchen morgenson dodd frank actually widened the federal safety net for big institutions  under that law  eight more giants were granted the right to tap the federal reserve for funding when the next crisis hits  at the same time  those eight may avoid dodd frank measures that govern how we re supposed to wind down institutions that get into trouble    money man    ex partner of goldman sachs steve mnuchin nominated to head the us treasury   image source  mgtvwten files wordpress com although mnuchin has cited that there s a need to restructure the dodd frank act because it would bring economic growth to regional banks and potentially open lending up to smaller businesses   there is still a fear that this may be a revolving door for the central banks to profit from as well zerohedge provides additional background details regarding munchin s career in banking  some more on mnuchin s background  starting his career in the early  as a trainee at salomon brothers before moving to goldman sachs in   mnuchin was front and center for the advent of instruments like collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps  he has called securitization  an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently   the pitfalls of the financing method came later  he s said mnuchin s father  robert mnuchin  was a partner at goldman sachs in the   the second youngest of five siblings  steven attended the prestigious riverdale country school and then yale university  where his roommate was edward lampert  who would go on to become a hedge fund manager and owner of sears  in addition to goldman  mnuchin also worked at soros fund management  whose founder  george soros  has funded many left leaning causes  where it gets even more bizarre is that mnuchin has donated frequently to democrats  including to clinton and barack obama  as a hedge fund manager  mnuchin is part of a group of business people trump has excoriated  in august  trump said hedge fund managers were  getting away with murder  as he touted his proposal to end the so called carried interest loophole  which gives private equity and hedge fund managers preferential tax treatment  the hedge fund guys didn t build this country   trump said at the time on cbs  face the nation   these are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky   he said   they are energetic  they are very smart  but a lot of them they are paper pushers  they make a fortune  they pay no tax  it s ridiculous  trump s disdain for wall street during his campaign run won t soon be forgotten by his supporters as the president elect s antithetical banking rhetoric will only be magnified by bringing mnuchin  along with his banking and hedge fund past  into the fold mnuchin s confirmation could be a contentious affair  if only for show  due to money made after his purchase of california s indymac following the financial crisis  bloomberg recently stated the following concerning mnuchin s role in the aftermath of the banking and housing meltdown  in   during the depths of the financial crisis  mnuchin joined with a group of former goldman sachs colleagues and billionaires to buy the remnants of indymac  which had collapsed after bingeing on reckless home loans during the frenzy of california s subprime mortgage boom  they changed the name to onewest  turned it around and sold the bank for a big gain last year  continuing  bloomberg outlines how mnuchin may have seized on a financial opportunity but stops short of condemning the us treasury nominee  it s unclear whether onewest s practices were worse than those of other banks during the financial crisis or how much blame mnuchin deserves for problems at a financial institution that was troubled before he bought it mnuchin declined to comment through a spokesman  but former onewest vice chairman david fawer said in a statement that the bank inherited loans from indymac with  extraordinarily high delinquency rates  and  worked tirelessly to modify thousands of loans to help homeowners through the financial crisis   the bank has pointed to positive reviews of its foreclosure and loan modification practices by the obama treasury department  the federal deposit insurance corp  and the office of the comptroller of the currency  interestingly  the nation reported that mnuchin purchased the failing indymac with an agreement to be  reimbursed  for costs associated to foreclosures that were financed by the company  the mnuchin group paid fdic    billion for the bank  far less than the value of indymac s assets  the fdic was so desperate to unload indymac that mnuchin and his colleagues were able to obtain  as part of the purchase deal  a so called  shared loss  agreement from the fdic which reimbursed these billionaires for much of their costs for foreclosing on people unlucky enough to have mortgages from indymac within a year  the group that the los angeles times called a  billionaires  club of private financiers  had paid themselves dividends of    billion  in other words  the fdic took much of the risk by subsidizing the bank s troubled assets  while mnuchin and his colleagues pocketed the profits  prior to considering mnuchin  trump was said to have considered former ceo of bb t john allison  an apparently harsh critic of the federal reserve banking system  the following was reported by business insider on november   trump will meet with john allison  the former ceo of the bank bb t and of the libertarian think tank the cato institute  there have been reports that allison is being considered for treasury secretary  trump s has on the campaign trail questioned the future of the federal reserve s political independence  but allison takes that rhetoric a step further  while running the the cato institute  allison wrote a paper in support of abolishing the fed    cabinet pick    president elect donald trump with fellow billionaire investor wilbur ross and vice president elect mike pence   image source   mediad publicbroadcasting  insiders    the white housejust as mnuchin s financial behaviour will be under watch  the same will hold true for the newly tapped commerce secretary position to be filled by billionaire investor wilbur ross a brief rundown of some of the more controversial aspects of ross s past were recently published at forbes  after an getting an mba from harvard  he spent two decades heading rothschild inc s bankruptcy advisory business  where he represented investors in trump s failing taj mahal casino in the early   ross and carl icahn convinced bondholders to strike a deal with trump  who some investors wanted to push out  which allowed trump to retain control of the property  continuing  the article described how ross invested in distressed coal companies in addition to banking opportunities  during the recession ross targeted another struggling industry  banking  he invested in troubled banks in england  greece and cyprus  he was also part of a group of investors that acquired a   stake in the bank of ireland during the height of europe s  debt crisis  he sold the last of his stake in   nearly tripling his initial investment  ross has also reportedly bet hundreds of millions of dollars on downtrodden oil and gas firms since the price of oil began to slide more than two years ago  incidentally  ross has maintained a tough public position on so called free trade deals like nafta and the soon to be defunct trans pacific partnership  tpp  but real questions still remain about his financial acquisitions during distressed times   is he a risk taking business visionary or a financial vulture ross has denied being a business liquidator for profit and states that he has worked to rebuild failing businesses whatever the case may be  mnuchin and ross have touted big corporate tax relief and large tax cuts to the middle class in the us  however  the public should be wary of their dealings with those on wall street and any new reform legislation aimed at deregulation banking deregulation and reform directed by wall street or one of their ilk  should be treated with great suspicion if history is any lesson below is another look at a passage from a report i complied prior to the election entitled  partners in crime  goldman sachs  the clintons   wall street   in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era  the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely the clinton goldman sachs wall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glass steagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of   officially titled the gramm leach bliley act   the original glass steagall was a depression age four part provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression      in fact  the gramm leach bliley act which repealed glass steagall  opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk  as banks became more interlinked simply put  clinton s repeal of glass steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic  subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in   all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton  and hillary still claims that   my husband did so well with the economy   really in a cross posted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the

the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group  becoming citigroup   which was dubbed the  citi travelers act  on capitol hill  it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glass steagall  then  in   in an act of corporate civil disobedience  citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging  such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two year review period of proposed mergers  the merger was premised on the expectation that glass steagall would be repealed  citigroup s co chairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut  at the time  it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years   congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glass steagall  both of trump s

       " 'new york  reuters    the supreme court signaled on monday it may dismiss a challenge to president donald trump s controversial travel ban after the white house announced tailored restrictions on eight countries that legal experts said stand a better chance at holding up in court   the high court canceled oral arguments scheduled for oct   to decide whether or not a march  executive order that temporarily blocked travel from six muslim majority countries was discriminatory  that ban expired on sunday  the president replaced it with a proclamation that indefinitely restricts travel from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  certain government officials from venezuela will also be barred  the new ban  trump s third  could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors   trump has been trying for most of the year to create a ban that passes court muster  the sunday proclamation  which he said is needed to screen out terrorist or public safety threats  could be less vulnerable to legal attack  scholars and other experts said  because it is the result of a months long analysis of foreign vetting procedures by u s  officials   it also might be less easily tied to trump s campaign trail statements some courts viewed as biased against muslims    the greater the sense that the policy reflects a considered  expert judgment  the less the temptation  by courts  to second guess the executive   said saikrishna prakash  a professor at the university of virginia school of law  in an email   it looks less like a matter of prejudice or a desire to fulfill a campaign promise   in its brief order  the high court asked the trump administration and the ban s challengers  including states and refugee advocacy organizations  to file briefs on whether the case should be dismissed  trump s march  ban sparked international outrage and was quickly blocked by federal courts as unconstitutional discrimination or a violation of immigration law   in june  the supreme court allowed a limited version of the ban to go ahead while the justices prepared to hear arguments over its legality on oct    a date they have now scrubbed  in   more than   nonimmigrant and immigrant visas were issued to the countries covered by the new ban  excluding venezuela  with nearly half of those going to iran  only nine north koreans immigrated to the united states in  and  were granted nonimmigrant visas  the new ban is set to go into effect on oct    but it already applies to five of the six countries covered by the march  ban  according to a u s  state department cable issued on sunday and obtained by reuters   to read the full cable click here  here   sudan was dropped from the list of banned countries after the sudanese government provided information required under the new criteria set out by the trump administration earlier this year  a white house official said on monday  the government has said the president has broad authority in immigration and national security matters  but challengers to the march ban had argued that it ran afoul of the u s  constitution s bar on favoring one religion over another   they cited statements trump made during his  campaign for president  including his call for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   within hours of sunday s proclamation  representatives for the hawaii  new york and california attorneys general said their offices were reviewing the new restrictions  advocacy organizations denounced it as more of the same  if the court does dismiss the case  there remains the separate issue of whether the justices will throw out the sweeping lower court rulings that invalidated the ban  the government would want to erase precedents that constrain its authority while the challengers would want to keep them in place for the same reasons    this is still a muslim ban  they simply added three additional countries   said becca heller  director of the international refugee assistance project  which previously sued to block trump s travel ban executive orders    of those countries  chad is majority muslim  travel from north korea is already basically frozen and the restrictions on venezuela only affect government officials on certain visas   heller said   sudan  which was in the march order  is no longer included   the worldwide review examined each country s ability to issue reliable electronic passports and share security risk data with the united states  overall   countries had problems  and  made improvements  including  that agreed to share information on known or suspected terrorists  trump s proclamation said   the review  at least arguably attenuates the link between the president s alleged bias and the policy   said margo schlanger  a university of michigan law school professor  however  challengers potentially could argue that the expanded ban violates the federal immigration and nationality act  which forbids the government from discriminating based on an individual s nationality when issuing immigrant visas   congress decided that it didn t want an immigration system

       " 'rome tunis  reuters    a powerful armed group  known for smuggling people from libya  is seeking legitimacy and state security jobs from the tripoli government in exchange for stopping migrant boats from leaving the coast of sabratha for italy  a senior group member said  the group  the anas al dabbashi brigade  struck a deal with libya s united nations backed government of national accord  gna  this summer to clamp down on trafficking  the senior brigade member  who gave his name as mohamed  told reuters  the need for the gna to strike such a deal would illustrate the power of armed groups in western libya  which continue to hold the real influence locally as they have since a  uprising that ousted muammar gaddafi  the revelation would also throw light on the fragility of the sharp recent reduction in migrant arrivals from italy  which took over from the aegean route as the main focus of european concerns in the crisis  the gna did not respond to requests for comment  local sources  who declined to be named  said there had been at least one meeting between government officials and ahmed al dabbashi  identified as one of the main  facilitators  of human smuggling in libya in a u n  report earlier this year   mohamed said there had been a number of such meetings  and that the brigade was also offered the possibility of an amnesty for past smuggling activity  to show it could uphold the deal with tripoli  the several hundred strong brigade has cracked down on departures with the help of the coastguard leading to an  percent fall in the arrival of rescued migrants in italy last month  mohamed said  with a national election looming in the first half of next year  the government in rome  which welcomed the sudden decline shown in official data  is under pressure to show it can stop  or at least slow  migration from the oil producing desert state  libya remains split between rival political camps and armed alliances  the gna has struggled to impose its authority on tripoli and other parts of western libya  and has been rejected by factions that control the east of the country  mohamed said the gna  under pressure from italy to halt the migrant flows  had exerted pressure on the dabbashi brigade  the gna  said that they would gather all the cities west of tripoli against us  and they would come and fight us          on the other hand  they have offered to let us join the police  and let us join the military   mohamed said   if this plan goes forward and the  tripoli  government was telling the truth     in six months time everybody in this battalion will be like normal police   a second source in sabratha spoke to ahmed al dabbashi  who confirmed that mohamed was a member of the brigade  it is the first time a brigade member has spoken at length about why the group suddenly shifted from smuggling to policing  a change first reported by reuters last month  some international media reported that dabbashi had received five million euros directly from italy s secret services to stop the migrant boats  but mohamed denied this  italy has also denied any direct payments to armed groups  the fragility of the security situation in sabratha was underscored by territorial clashes that erupted there over the weekend  with dabbashi s group battling cross town rivals in some of the heaviest fighting the city has seen in recent years  explosions could be heard as far away as the port of zawiya   km   miles  away  both sides in the fighting claim to have the backing of the tripoli government  and both battled together to drive islamic state forces out of the area last year       with italy and the eu offering millions of euros to local authorities in libya who can put a cap on trafficking  armed groups have an interest in proving that they are the only ones who can police the territory   this smuggling thing   everybody knows that libya is not going to be like this forever   mohamed said   if you are just a little bit smart  you will go with the government   as a result of the policing by dabbashi and coastguard interceptions  arrivals of rescued migrants in italy fell  percent in july from a year earlier  and declined more than  percent in august   two months that had been peak periods during the previous three years  overall  there have been more than   arrivals in italy this year  a decline of more than  percent compared to   official italian data show  to rein in smuggling  italy has spearheaded efforts to bolster the libyan coast guard  and it is dealing directly with local governments to try to offer incentives for them to shut it down  including with sabratha s mayor  hussein al thwadi  thwadi sought support directly from italy  meeting the ambassador earlier this month and interior minister marco minniti in july      the dabbashi brigade  which also guards an oil and gas facility west of sabratha run jointly by libya s national oil corporation  noc  and italian firm eni  denied any direct contacts with italy  it is allied to brigade   a group of some  soldiers aligned with the gna    we only have deals with the  tripoli  government   mohamed said   they said they might forgive all of what we have done in the past   he added  referring to people smuggling  but it is unclear if tripoli can deliver on its promises to integrate dabbashi s men  or whether any group can hold the line against forces who want to keep smuggling  on saturday  libyan coastguard officials said they had turned back more than   migrants traveling in at least eight boats  on the same day  the dabbashi brigade intercepted about   more  said mohamed  more than   were rescued at sea and brought to italy   a lot of people are pressuring us to stop this   mohamed said of dabbashi s

october    the electoral college is not a creation of the constitution   perez said during a lecture at indiana university law school   it doesn t have to be there  the electoral college  a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the founding fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states  is clearly laid out in article ii of the constitution   each state shall appoint  in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct  a number of electors  equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress  perez has previously stated that president donald trump  didn t win  last november s election because hillary clinton won the popular vote following his comment  perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact   in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote  there s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says  we will allocate our vote  our electoral votes  to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling  electoral votes do the same   perez said   i m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was maryland  the main supporters of the plan put forward by perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the constitution  not an argument that the system doesn t exist the comment from perez came during a lecture honoring former indiana democratic sen  birch bayh  who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine  via  wfbour previous report on the electoral college please share this with the clueless left    if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote  small and rural states would become irrelevant  and campaigns would spend their time in large  populous districts    the electoral college remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the constitution empowered it to select presidents  though occasionally maligned  this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the american people the founding fathers created the electoral college after much debate and compromise  but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents  though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency  that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections        and  some see the electoral college as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few  select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the united states  others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones every four years  around election time  there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct  national popular vote the founders  collegeas one of the heritage foundations legal experts  hans von spakovsky  noted in a paper on the electoral college   in creating the basic architecture of the american government  the founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule  some elements of the electoral college  such as the indirect vote through intermediaries  were hotly debated at the  constitutional convention  it was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal  traitor  or similar kind of heinous person  the founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the american system  but they feared a kind of pure  unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past the product of the founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring  and we would be wise to leave it intact alexander hamilton defended the electoral college in federalist   he argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president  but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station  and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation  and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice  hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability  and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements  than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes  as students of ancient history  the founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy  and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch  they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people  the electoral college was a compromise  neither fully democratic nor aristocratic the constitution states each state shall appoint  in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct  a number of electors  equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress in addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule  the founding fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities  america s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states  not just the american people as an undifferentiated mass the total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the district of columbia included after the passage of the  amendment adds up to   the winner must receive a majority  or   of these votes to become president the system empowers states  especially smaller ones  because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers  farmers in iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in new york  a more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account the states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors  in the early days of the republic  most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors  rather than the people  but  over time  the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead  every state has opted for popular election at least since the civil war calls to abolishmodern opponents of the electoral college argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution  criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state by state system of voting calls to fundamentally change the electoral college reached a peak after republican george w  bush defeated democrat al gore in the tightly contested  election  gore narrowly won the national popular vote  and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the supreme court stepping in was unfair one organization  national popular vote  has worked toward eliminating the electoral college through an amendment to the constitution or a state compact  national popular vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country this plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support  but heritage s von spakovsky has called it bad policy  based on mistaken assumptions  swing states  he wrote   can change from election to election  and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable  many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote  those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote but this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers  swing states change over time  and the  election could be a prime example of swing state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map additionally  if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote  small and rural states would become irrelevant  and campaigns would spend their time in large  populous districts finally are the democrats proud of this

clinton needs sanders  voters more than ever  sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  arrived in philadelphia with   of   delegates after winning  million votes in the democratic nominating contest  to many of sanders  backers  clinton is a bridge too far  they see her as the kind of political insider  backed by reams of corporate money  that drove them to sanders and his fight to rein in wall street and remove income inequality  others simply do not trust her  opinion polls show   in a reuters ipsos poll released at the end of june  some  percent of sanders  backers said they would vote for trump  and  percent would support neither clinton nor trump  sanders won the states of colorado  indiana  michigan  and new hampshire in the run up to the convention  and nearly won iowa   all states that could be closely contested by trump in the general election  clinton likely will need some portion of sanders  support to stay competitive in those states   clinton s campaign had hoped in

he asked them to switch their allegiance to clinton   brothers and sisters   he said over their jeers   this is the real world that we live in  trump is a bully and a demagogue   people started shouting back   so is hillary   sanders did not mention clinton again  but he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans   as soon as he said back clinton  everyone stopped listening   said cindy melchert  a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park  a michigan native  melchert said she would not vote for clinton in november under any

from florida adorned with buttons backing sanders  said she planned to vote for clinton in the general election   yes   she said   we ll hold our nose and vote   others felt their fellow sanders supporters had taken the movement too far   we are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self absorbed   said melissa robbins  who worked for the sanders campaign in philadelphia   not voting

is a  cyberpower  that washington should respect   three officials  all speaking on condition of anonymity  said the breaches of the democratic national committee  dnc  were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to russian intelligence agencies or criminals  for example  said one official  the hackers used some cyrillic characters  worked during russian government business hours but not on russian religious or political holidays  either these guys were incredibly sloppy  in which case it s not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected  or they wanted us to know they were russian   said the official  private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities  these experts   who said they have examined the breach in detail   said the cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message  other giveaways  such as a tainted internet protocol address  also were difficult to find  russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than china s but not impossible to decipher  private sector experts said  but the russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years  security experts said  especially when they are trying to move quickly  false flags have grown more common  but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the dnc case  the two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions  said laura galante  head of global threat intelligence at fireeye  whose mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company  crowdstrike  russian officials have dismissed the allegations of moscow s involvement as absurd  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov  in his only response to reporters  said   i don t want to use four letter words    while private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political party s hacking months ago  embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the wikileaks anti secrecy group just as the democratic party prepared to anoint hillary clinton as its presidential candidate for the nov   election  dnc chairwoman  debbie wasserman schultz  resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination  u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  the committee is supposed to be neutral  the u s  intelligence officials conceded that they had  based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence  but suggested russia s aim probably was much broader than simply undermining clinton s campaign  they said the hack fit a pattern of russian president vladimir putin pushing back on what he sees as the united states and its european allies trying to weaken russia   call it the cyber equivalent of buzzing nato ships and planes using fighters with russian flags on their tails   said one official  two sources familiar with democratic party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of democratic party officials were targeted as well as servers   they said that the fbi had advised the dnc that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials  private accounts  they also said the fbi also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials  the dnc hired crowdstrike to investigate the hack  it spent  about six weeks  from late april to about june  or    monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers   who they believed were russian   operated inside the systems  one of the sources said  what actions  if any  the obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved  a former white house cyber security official said  in past cases  administration officials have decided to publicly blame north korea and indict members of china s military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming   and increased awareness brought to cyber security   outweighed potential risks  the former official said  but  the russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious   the former official said   russia is a much more aggressive  capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm  and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely  the former official  and a source familiar with the democratic party investigations  said that they also were unaware of any u s  intelligence clearly demonstrating that wikileaks had received the hacked

on oil prices that weren t sustainable  and now that s all coming unwound  we have never had deficits of ten percent of gdp back to back  or even still four or five percent four or five years into a recovery we have a runaway budget where the population is getting older and older    people are retiring every day  nothing is being done about social security  it s a festering time bomb  and we re not sure how it will explode  but we know it isn t sustainable  we have a wall street that is more addicted to pure overnight gambling and trading and speculation for the ultra short run that is driven by robo traders  the so called hft money  like never before  it s unstable  that s why we see things happen like the overnight  percent gain with the swiss franc when the swiss national bank pulled the pay forty percent overnight   not overnight  but in a couple of minutes or seconds when there were hundreds of billions of short positions in the swiss franc  all of these things have never existed simultaneously  not only in the united states  but worldwide  all the central banks are doing it  we re reaching the point where it s unsustainable  things are going to give and break  but the good thing is it s going to be more a disaster in the financial markets in my view  less some kind of great depression impact on main street  it will be difficult on main street  but wall street is in

america said  and another center was evacuated on tuesday morning in san diego  california  according to police  also  vandals toppled about  headstones at the chesed shel emeth society cemetery in st  louis  missouri  over the weekend   the anti semitic threats targeting our jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil   trump told reporters   he was speaking at the end of a tour of the national museum of african american history and culture in washington  which trump said showed  why we have to fight bigotry  intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms   the comments marked a change for trump  who had not explicitly and publicly condemned the threats against jews when asked last week  instead  he spoke more generally about his hopes of making the nation less  divided   the president reacted with anger at a news conference last week when a journalist from a jewish magazine asked how his government planned to  take care  of a rise in threats  trump berated the reporter for asking a  very insulting  question  appearing to believe the reporter was accusing him of being anti semitic   number one  i am the least anti semitic person that you ve ever seen in your entire life   the president said  adding that he was also the least

characterization   i wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area   he told reporters when asked about goldstein s comment   hopefully as time goes by they ll recognize his commitment to civil rights   jewish groups criticized the white house for omitting any mention of jews in its statement marking holocaust memorial day last month  the white house said the omission was

       " 'washington  reuters    president donald trump said on wednesday he would ban transgender people from the u s  military  a move appealing to some in his conservative political base but creating uncertainty about the fate of thousands of transgender service members  the surprise announcement by trump  who as a presidential candidate last year vowed to fight for lesbians  gays  bisexuals and transgender people  came in a series of morning twitter posts  it drew condemnation from rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties as politically motivated discrimination but was praised by conservative activists and some republicans  the administration has not determined whether transgender individuals already serving in the military would be immediately thrown out  a point the white house and pentagon have yet to decide  trump spokeswoman sarah sanders said  a transgender ban would reverse democratic former president barack obama s policy and halts years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity   after consultation with my generals and military experts  please be advised that the united states government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u s  military   trump tweeted  without naming any of the generals or experts   our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail   he said  sanders said trump had  extensive discussions with his national security team   and defense secretary jim mattis was informed after the president made the decision on tuesday   this was about military readiness   sanders told a briefing   this was about unit cohesion  this was about resources within the military  and nothing more   the pentagon earlier referred questions about trump s decision to the white house  critics said the health costs of caring for transgender service members were a tiny portion of the military s healthcare budget and trump s policy change was based on prejudice  his action unleashed a torrent of legal threats from civil liberties advocates seeking plaintiffs willing to challenge the ban in court and sparked a protest by hundreds who rallied outside an armed forces recruiting station in manhattan s times square   we are in a crisis  this is a dark day for everyone   brad hoylman  new york s sole openly gay state senator  said as he addressed the crowd  which carried  resist  signs amid chants of   hey hey  ho ho  donald trump has got to go   trump s tweet caught some white house officials by surprise   a senior administration official said trump had been determined to act for a while but the question was the timing  with advisers split on whether to conduct reviews before announcing the move  the announcement at least temporarily changed the subject in washington  where trump s administration faces investigations into his presidential campaign s contacts with russia and has struggled to win major legislative victories  it was not the first time trump has targeted transgender people since taking office in january  in february  he rescinded protections for transgender students put in place by obama that had let them use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity  senate armed forces committee chairman john mccain   the most prominent military veteran in congress  who was a navy pilot and prisoner of war during the vietnam war   called trump s announcement unclear and inappropriate until a pentagon study on the issue is completed and reviewed by mattis  the military leadership and lawmakers  tony perkins  president of the family research council advocacy group  was among those praising trump  saying   our troops shouldn t be forced to endure hours of transgender  sensitivity  classes and politically correct distractions   under obama  the pentagon last year announced it was ending its ban on transgender people serving openly  calling the prohibition outdated  the defense department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year  but mattis on june  approved a six month delay in that step  transgender service members already number about   active duty personnel  with about   more in the military reserves  according to a rand corporation think tank study cited last year by obama s defense secretary  ash carter   to choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military   carter said on wednesday  noting the existing ranks of transgender individuals serving  capably and honorably   advocacy groups said trump s policy was open to legal challenge under the u s  constitution s guarantee of equal protection under the law  american civil liberties union attorney joshua block said trump had rejected the  basic humanity  of transgender service members   there are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country   block said   the president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country   the house of representatives  top democrat  nancy pelosi  noted that a pentagon commissioned study determined the cost of providing medically necessary transition related care involving transgender service members would amount to about one  of  percent of the military s healthcare budget   the study put the cost at    million to    million a year of the more than   billion the defense department spends on healthcare   once again  president trump has shown his conduct is driven not by honor  decency  or national security  but by raw prejudice   pelosi said  retired colonel sheri swokowski    the highest ranking openly transgender veteran  joined the criticism    transgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesn t trust them   she said   the bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country   u s  representative ileana ros lehtinen  a republican whose son is transgender  said on twitter   no american  no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity  should be prohibited from honor   privilege of serving our nation   transgender celebrity caitlyn jenner defended  patriotic transgender americans  in the military and asked trump on twitter   what happened to your promise to fight for them   canada s military also took to twitter on wednesday to say it welcomes citizens  of all sexual orientations and gender identities   adding the hashtag  diversityisourstrength  but vicky hartzler  a republican congresswoman  praised trump for changing obama s  costly and damaging policy   the u s  military s ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces ended under obama in  after congress passed legislation in  reversing a law dubbed  don t ask  don t tell  that had forced the ouster of thousands of service members and others to hide their sexual orientation  the pentagon

complicated  less direct  crony capitalist flavor  in other words  it s not direct socialism  but it might as well be by mucking around this way  clinton gains the benefit of deception  she can argue that  both the left and the right   by  right   she of course means the craziest of republicans  not actual conservatives  have proposed elements of her plan  so she gets to smear her frankenstein

we get into the mud slinging  let s do what most journalists do not and give some actual hard facts about clinton s proposal   do any of you also scan news articles looking for actual facts instead of paid spokespeople s lying spin  it s hard to find those  isn t it   the full proposal doesn t seem available  probably so they can tweak its details in response to initial criticism   reporters have gotten  three fact sheets   msnbc says  inside higher ed kindly posted them  a news summary of the major points  under the plan  which was outlined by clinton advisers on sunday  about   billion in grants would go to states that guarantee students would not have to take out loans to cover tuition at four year public colleges and universities  in return for the money  states would have to end budget cuts to increase spending over time on higher education  while also working to slow the growth of tuition  thought the plan does not require states to cap it    nyt  military veterans  lower income students and those who complete a national service program  like americorps  would go to school for free in the clinton plan   ap   she would also expand income based repayment programs  allowing every student borrower to enroll in a plan that would cap their payments at  percent of their income with remaining debt forgiven after  years    ap  student borrowers would be expected to work at least  hours a week to contribute  while their families would continue contributing under the current income based model  clinton s plan would also expand a tax credit from    to    for families paying for college    msnbc  her campaign says she will create a dedicated fund for historically black colleges and universities  and will expand americorps from   to   members    msnbc  mrs

against people who earn lots less money than she does  envy and greed are our society s favorite sins  after all federal meddling is the problem  not the answerthe most expensive portion of clinton s

wills to wring concessions from beijing on issues from trade to north korea is unclear  the call between trump and tsai ing wen was the first by a u s  president elect or president with a taiwanese leader since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition to china from taiwan in   it prompted a diplomatic protest from china which the outgoing obama administration warned could undermine progress in relations with beijing  which has been carefully built up over decades by both republican and democratic administrations  analysts say it could provoke military confrontation with china if pressed too far  trump officials and vice president elect mike pence sought to play down the significance of the  minute conversation  saying it was a  courtesy  call and not intended to show a policy shift  however  trump fueled the fire on sunday by complaining about chinese economic and military policy on twitter  while on monday an economic adviser to trump  stephen moore  said if beijing did not like it   screw  em   analysts  including senior former u s  officials  said the call appeared to be at least an initial shot across china s bow to signal a tougher approach to beijing  which includes plans for a buildup in the u s  military  in part in response to china s growing power in the asia pacific region  jon huntsman  reportedly among the candidates to become trump s secretary of state  was quoted by the new york times as saying at the weekend that taiwan might prove a  useful leverage point  in dealings with china  trump adviser and china hawk peter navarro  and former u s  ambassador to the united nations john bolton  another in the mix for the top u s  diplomatic role  have both proposed using degrees of escalation on taiwan to pressure china to step back from its pursuit of territory in east asia  navarro  who has produced books and multipart television documentaries warning of the dangers of china s rise  has suggested stepped up engagement with taiwan  including assistance with a submarine development program   he argued that washington should stop referring to a  one china  policy  but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize taipei  saying  there is no need to unnecessarily poke the panda   bolton though  in an article in january  countenanced a  diplomatic ladder of escalation  that could start with receiving taiwanese diplomats officially at the state department and lead to restoring full diplomatic recognition  evan medeiros  a former official who served as president barack obama s top adviser on east asia  said this was a highly risky strategy   here s the reality  china let us all know very clearly in the mid  that the taiwan issue is a war and peace issue   medeiros said   is that a proposition that the u s  should test   the taiwan issue is so politically sensitive and ranks so high in chinese priorities of interest they are not going to begin trading anything away for it  and if the u s  decided to establish formal diplomatic relations with taiwan  it could easily precipitate a military crisis in northeast asia   he said  douglas paal  a white house official under republican administrations who served as u s  representative to taiwan from    said the approach of trump advisers seemed rooted in the   when china was much weaker and the united states in a better position to take a tougher line   the problem is that beijing decided in  on a  year  military  buildup so that it would never have to swallow such stuff again   paal said  he said chinese president xi jinping is seeking to cement his position at a congress of the ruling communist party next year    were he to look soft on something like making the u s  office in taipei into an official diplomatic outpost  xi would be devoured by his rivals  and he won t let that happen   paal said  chris murphy  a democratic member of the u s  senate foreign relations committee  said using taiwan as a way to pressure china to cooperate on north korea s nuclear program or on trade could be counterproductive   pressing china on taiwan won t likely bring them to the table on north korea and currency   he wrote on twitter   risks backing them into a dark  nasty corner   two sources familiar with the debate on china policy within the trump camp said bolton and other hard liners had encouraged taiwanese leaders to approach the president elect   however  former u s  secretary of state henry kissinger and others advising trump and his transition team have cautioned against an open break with the four decade  one china  policy  they said   as a result  trump first presented the request for a phone conversation as a personal matter rather than a harbinger of a shift in u s  policy  which left japan and other u s  asian allies unfazed  however  the sources said that after trump tweeted about chinese currency manipulation  import tariffs and the south china sea  some asian leaders were asking whether he was deliberately provoking china  potentially leading to a dangerous escalation of tensions  chas freeman  a former u s  diplomat who was then president richard nixon s interpreter on his historic trip to china in   said he thought chinese officials were waiting to see what trump s intentions were as president   they  chinese  don t want to humiliate mr  trump or get into an emotional confrontation with him   he

she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly  but steve kroft  what was your reaction when you found out about it president barack obama  this is one of those issues that i think is legitimate  but the fact that for the last three months this is all that s been spoken about is an indication that we re in presidential political season steve kroft  do you agree with what president clinton has said and secretary clinton has said  that this is not  not that big a deal  do you agree with that president barack obama  well  i m not going to comment on steve kroft  you think it s not that big a deal president barack obama  what i think is that it is important for her to answer these questions to the satisfaction of the american public  and they can make their own judgment  i can tell you that this is not a situation in which america s national security was endangered steve kroft  this administration has prosecuted people for having classified material on their private computers president barack obama  well  i  there s no doubt that there had been breaches  and these are all a matter of degree  we don t get an impression that here there was purposely efforts  on  in  to hide something or to squirrel away information  but again  i m gonna leave it to this can only be seen as an attempt by obama to tell the federal prosecutors who will ultimately decide what  if any  charges should be made in this case that there is nothing to see here those statements angered f b i  agents who have been working for months to determine whether ms  clinton s email setup had in fact put any of the nation s secrets at risk  according to current and former law enforcement officials investigators have not reached any conclusions about whether the information on the server had been compromised or whether to recommend charges  according to the law enforcement officials  but to investigators  it sounded as if mr  obama had already decided the answers to their questions and cleared anyone involved of wrongdoing the white house quickly backed off the president s remarks and said mr  obama was not trying to influence the investigation  but his comments spread quickly  raising the ire of officials who saw an instance of the president trying to influence the outcome of a continuing investigation   and not for the first time a spokesman for the f b i  declined to comment  but ron hosko  a former senior f b i  official who retired in  and is now the president of the law enforcement legal defense fund  said it was inappropriate for the president to  suggest what side of the investigation he is on  when the f b i  is still investigating  injecting politics into what is supposed to be a fact finding inquiry leaves a foul taste in the f b i  s mouth and makes them fear that no matter what they find  the justice department will take the president s signal and not bring a case   said mr  hosko  who maintains close contact with current agents several current and former law enforcement officials  including those close to the investigation  expressed similar sentiments in separate interviews over several days  most  however  did so only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the case contrary to what hillary s campaign is saying  we now have it on pretty good authority that the fbi is conducting an investigation under the part of the espionage act that pertains to gross negligence in the handling of defense information  that information  at a minimum  is the two top secret

obama administration s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government s  compelling interest  to protect women s health   this administration s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision   top house democrat nancy pelosi said  the administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception  on the basis of moral conviction  for non profit and for profit companies  federal rules implemented under obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control  but religious houses of worship were exempted  some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage  and the supreme court ruled in  that they could object on religious grounds  case western reserve university school of law professor jonathan adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions   why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step   adler said  ellen kelsay  chief strategy officer at the national business group on health  a lobbying group for large companies  said   most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available   according to one estimate  only  percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage   hhs has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides   it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption   said mark rienzi  one of the lawyers for the little sisters of the poor  the order of roman catholic nuns  which runs care homes for the elderly  had challenged the mandate in court  the little sisters and other christian nonprofit employers objected to a  compromise offered by the obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage   the justice department released two memos that will serve as the government s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions  federal rules and grant making   in another decision popular with trump s evangelical supporters  the justice department on wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees  trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military  trump s support among evangelical voters  a major force in his  election victory  remains strong  but has

democrats thought we d be able to scoop up at least a seat or two   especially when it came to jon ossoff of the georgia district  election  however  we fell short by less than four points  tom price  who left to become trump s health and human services secretary  carried that district by more than  points last november  that trend has been consistent throughout all of the special elections  with democrats making major gains point wise  however  moral victories are not victories  and therefore people are pointing fingers  right now  the fingers are being pointed squarely at house minority leader nancy pelosi democrats like rep  tim ryan of ohio are calling for her to step aside for new leadership  ryan said of pelosi and the democratic party at large after the ossoff loss  we d better take a good  long  strong look in the mirror and realize that the problem is us  it s the party  ryan went on to praise jon ossoff as a  great  political candidate who still couldn t carry the national baggage of the democratic party  it is also worth noting that ryan did challenge pelosi for her leadership position last november and lost spectacularly  so there could still be bitterness there  rep  seth moulton  d ma  criticized the idea of keeping leader pelosi as well  we need to have a plan  we need to have a vision  we need to tell americans why democrats will be better  not just why trump is bad  and i don t think we re doing enough of that  and i think that s evident in this  georgia  race  this is an empty argument  though  because ossoff did not run against trump  he ran on healthcare and the economy  what largely hurt him was his lack of a resume  the fact that the district had been handily in gop hands for  years  and the fact that republicans stick together when democrats don t  in this election  lots of democrats accused him of not being liberal enough  also  he never sufficiently answered for living outside the district he was running to represent however  in my humble opinion  what they want to do to nancy pelosi would be disastrous  we split the party between the bernie sanders elizabeth warren hard left and the hillary clinton barack obama left of center in   and look where that got us  when the party is in tatters  it is time to come together to beat the common enemy  the republicans who are steadily destroying the united states of america as we speak  while we bicker amongst ourselves  demand ideological purity  and attack those who share our same values  they are rolling back civil rights continuing to gerrymander districts to render democratic votes useless  using non existent voter fraud to block people from exercising their right to vote  planning to kill us by taking our healthcare away  destroying public education  and making sure we won t have a planet to live on if they get their way now  i know all of the arguments  pelosi is the old guard and it s time for her to go  the republicans always yoke our candidate to her  paint her as an out of touch  san francisco liberal  and that means that moderates are afraid to vote for that candidate because they fear a far left agenda  newsflash  no matter who is in leadership  they ll say those things anyway  they think all democrats are just like nancy pelosi  elizabeth warren  and bernie sanders  despite the fact that this party is as diverse as the people of the nation  that diversity can be our greatest strength rather than a weakness if we just stop fighting one another long enough to heal old wounds from  at least it seems that the democratic national committee is speaking out against this dangerous move from inside the house democratic caucus  deputy chairman rep  keith ellison said of what is going on  republicans have held this seat for  years  in a normal year  we wouldn t even have any shot  we have closed the gap dramatically  i mean  they re the ones that better be worried  i never thought i d say this  but i think we should take the advice of former gop congressman and host of msnbc s morning joe  joe scarborough on this one setting pelosi up as scapegoat does democrats no good  get a candidate that matches the district and you will win  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  june    is correct  don t run a new york city liberal democrat in ohio  find some tim ryan replicas and we ll carry the whole state  loathe as i am to say this  in places like south carolina and rural north carolina and georgia  find someone who s a bit more like joe manchin than say  maxine waters  a dino is better than a republican any day  if you can get away with it in those districts  run someone like claire mccaskill  match the candidate to the political environment  adjust their positions to match  and we win  feel out the political landscape in any given area  also   and this is most important   get some candidates that can speak to the working class  such as the democrat from wisconsin  randy bryce  who has launched a moving campaign ad to announce his challenge to current house speaker paul ryan  get a strong  working family economic message  combine it with our overall message of tolerance and acceptance for all and pit it against the open bigotry of the gop  and we re golden throwing one another under the bus  re litigating the  primaries and general election  and continuing this infighting does nothing but tear the party apart

treatment from muslims  increasing tensions and accusations that christians communities are  foreign bodies  supported and defended by western powers   the chaldean bishop of aleppo  antoine audo sj  said  speeches  or  measures and laws  that seem to privilege christians  feeds fanaticism and extremism  archbishop bashar warda of erbil  on the other hand  although more positive about the development  said that the media puts christians in iraq  at greater risk  when they  cry out that this is a  muslim ban   he wrote in an interview   here in iraq we christians cannot afford to throw out words carelessly as the media in the west can do  i would ask those in the media who use every issue to stir up division to think about this  for the media these things become an issue of ratings  but for us the danger is real  don t help us or we ll get beaten againit s true that part of what s going on  especially from sako and audo  is that these religious leaders don t want their flocks to flee  i can understand the desire to stay   as christians   audo said   we ask to be helped not to emigrate  but to have peace in our countries  in order to continue our life and our witness in the land where we were born  contrast those responses with that of anglican canon andrew white  better known as the vicar of baghdad  when his parishioners in baghdad were getting killed  he responded with   i just say   i will stay  i will not leave you   but i can t advise them to stay  the liquidation of christianity from the middle east is heartbreaking  but what is going on here with these

please don t help me  he ll get mad and beat me up again   it s the same type of victim mentality   don t help us   these christian leaders say   because they ll increase our persecution  asking for decent treatment is asking for itthis  battered woman syndrome  in middle eastern christians runs deep  this mental conditioning has been a plague on middle eastern christians for a long time  in her book  christianity in iraq   suha rassam recounts muslim christian relations in the years when iraq moved from british rule toward independence  under the monarchy a military coup toppled in   the constitution that the british helped iraq draft gave full and equal citizenship rights to all minorities  but this type of thinking is foreign to middle eastern christians  minds  given their history of being terrorized by the muslims they live under  standing up for representation is a sure way to get cut down  when iraq s old constitution was being drafted  the memories of the last decades of the ottoman rule were still alive  and as rassam writes   the massacres of these communities  armenians  syrian orthodox  syrian catholics  etc   were partly attributed to western european policies  and the failure of the europeans to stand by their promises to them  one of the iraqi newspapers warned   do not forget the fate of the armenians and the assyrians who put their trust in christian powers and were practically exterminated in the process  when helping hurtsit s true that western intervention helped the christian communities at times  but rassam says much of it led to greater tragedy for christians  complicating the relationship between muslims and christians  she writes   the christians were seen  by the muslims  as collaborators with the europeans and identified with their policies  what americans and most people in the west don t realize is that not only do these christian have hundreds of years of oppressed mentality to overcome  but that the muslims  just like wife beaters  increase their wrathful acts upon their victims when they seek help  the increase in violence is usually triggered by a move of any western power to help the christians but the answer cannot be for america or the west to do nothing  that s what the obama administration did  and the persecution did not stop  the answer  as difficult as it is for americans to accept  is exactly what president trump is trying to do  give priority to the christians who want a chance to flee the violence surely the wholesale removal of christians from the middle east is a tragedy of historic
